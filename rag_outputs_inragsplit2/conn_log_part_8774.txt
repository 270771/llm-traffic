Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from the IP 44.61.12.164 to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic for ping floods, the presence of many ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame from a single source IP to multiple destinations strongly suggests a ping flood.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 44.61.12.164 is the apparent attacker; destination IPs include 163.252.44.38, 163.252.254.9, 163.252.47.166, 163.252.254.193, 163.252.81.196, 163.252.255.198, 163.252.44.76, 163.252.81.197, 163.252.102.6, 163.252.83.24, 163.252.19.100, 163.252.83.166, 163.252.37.242.
- Ports are not relevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 44.61.12.164 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP or related IPs.
- Conduct a network scan on 44.61.12.164 to identify if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate and contain the source.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
