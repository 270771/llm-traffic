Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: Although there are multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) from source IP 163.171.168.73 to various destination IPs, the total count of such instances is only 5, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomalies or heuristic matches are present in the anomaly CSV to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from this source IP. If the count reaches or exceeds 10 within a short time frame, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, investigate the source IP 163.171.168.73 for any suspicious behavior or known malicious activity.
