Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV does not reference any heuristic 20 (Ping flood) or related ICMP anomalies. The only anomaly listed is heuristic 10 (SYN attack) on a different IP and port, unrelated to ICMP traffic.  

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping flood attacks involving ICMP type 8 traffic.  
- The current anomalies and logs indicate TCP SYN flood or other port-based attacks, not ICMP-based flooding.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) further by correlating with firewall logs and endpoint behavior for potential SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests to promptly detect ping floods.
