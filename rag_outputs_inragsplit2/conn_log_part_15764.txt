Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is indicated by this log entry. The ICMP type 3 typically signals network issues or scanning activity but does not constitute a flood attack.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate any repeated ICMP type 3 messages for possible network misconfigurations or reconnaissance attempts.
