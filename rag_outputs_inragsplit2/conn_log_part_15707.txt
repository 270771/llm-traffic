Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.236.221.123 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many frameworks) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.228.x.x subnet and one from 163.252.x.x, all targeting destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping flood traffic.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 52.236.221.123 for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these sources are part of a botnet or compromised hosts for further remediation.
