Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 12 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 161.67.57.135 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- The ICMP type 8 is the only type associated with ping floods, and the count exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood (heuristic 20 commonly relates to volumetric ICMP floods).
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet are flooding the destination IP 161.67.57.135. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended response:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range at the perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other logs for potential coordinated attacks.
  3. Engage network operations to verify if the destination host is critical and assess impact.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services (e.g., scrubbing centers).
  5. Alert incident response team for potential escalation and forensic analysis.
