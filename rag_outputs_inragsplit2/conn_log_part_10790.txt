Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This exceeds the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- All ICMP packets are directed toward a single destination IP, 54.179.180.7, from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x subnet, indicating a distributed pattern typical of a ping flood.
- No anomalies or heuristic matches are explicitly found in the anomaly CSV, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.231.212, 157.17.174.244, 157.17.28.57, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.179.180.7. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests targeting 54.179.180.7 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16) if they are not legitimate users.
- Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
- Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential service degradation and consider deploying DDoS mitigation services if the attack volume increases.
