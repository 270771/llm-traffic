Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP type 8 (echo request) from 203.78.177.156 to 115.235.234.230, but only a single instance is present.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 0 (echo reply) from 133.228.185.129 to 52.238.213.5, which is not type 8 and thus not part of a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets in total, and no anomaly records or heuristic matches are found to override this threshold.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the provided data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have been flagged in other logs or threat intelligence feeds.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out potential reconnaissance or low-rate ICMP scanning.
