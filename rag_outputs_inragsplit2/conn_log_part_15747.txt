Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP connection record shows an ICMP type of 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks require multiple ICMP type 8 packets (at least 10 instances) and no such packets are present, this does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The ICMP type 11 is typically related to traceroute or TTL expiration, not an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if additional logs show repeated ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious activity.
