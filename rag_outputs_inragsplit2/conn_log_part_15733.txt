Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference heuristic 20 (Ping flood) or any ICMP-related anomalies; they mostly reference heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (other).  
- Heuristic 20 specifically flags ping flood attacks, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source or to the same destination, none of which are present here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the anomalies related to heuristic 10 (SYN attack) as indicated by anomaly_782 and anomaly_772, which suggest possible SYN flood or TCP connection flood attempts.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Verify if any network devices or IDS sensors are dropping or not logging ICMP traffic properly, as this could mask ping flood detection.
