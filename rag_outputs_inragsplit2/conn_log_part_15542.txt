Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 1 and 13, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.  
- Only two ICMP packets are present, far below the threshold of 10 required for ping flood detection unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not available here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No attack is present based on the given data. Further investigation could focus on the nature of ICMP type 1 (Destination Unreachable) and type 13 (Timestamp) traffic if unusual volumes are observed, but this does not indicate a ping flood.
