Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets all targeting the single destination IP 3.30.218.60. This volume and concentration of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple source IPs to one target matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly references heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood, with the anomaly category code "ntscICecrqICecrprp" indicating a NetworkScanICMP class. This confirms the detection aligns with known ping flood heuristics and taxonomy.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.240.x.x range (e.g., 133.240.215.232, 133.240.31.166, 133.240.23.65, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 3.30.218.60. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor the target host 3.30.218.60 for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blocking the attack traffic closer to the source.
  4. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate similar ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a forensic analysis on the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts part of a botnet.

This is a confirmed ping flood attack as per heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class NetworkScanICMP, requiring immediate mitigation to protect the targeted host.
