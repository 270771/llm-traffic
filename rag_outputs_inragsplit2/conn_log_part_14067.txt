Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 34.33.149.154 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.247.175.38, 133.247.31.59, 133.247.134.51, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 34.33.149.154 on ICMP type 8 (ping) with no source or destination ports applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet.
  2. Monitor the target host 34.33.149.154 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
