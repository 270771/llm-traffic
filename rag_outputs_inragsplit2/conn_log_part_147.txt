Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type values in the field before the packet length (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 0), but none show ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of at least 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.
- The traffic appears to be various ICMP types (e.g., type 3 = Destination Unreachable, type 0 = Echo Reply), which do not indicate a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The absence of anomaly records and heuristic context limits further classification.

Next steps:
- Investigate the purpose of the multiple ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 2 (Source Quench) messages from 203.65.114.222, as these may indicate network issues or misconfigurations.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or unusual traffic volume from this source IP.
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy in future analyses.
