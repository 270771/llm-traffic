Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (lines with src IPs 61.74.147.114 and 139.179.133.57). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present are not type 8, so they do not contribute to a ping flood pattern.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The traffic appears to be normal or low-volume ICMP activity.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of these IPs have a history of suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence sources.  
- If ICMP type 8 packets increase to 10 or more from a single source without legitimate reason, re-evaluate for ping flood.
