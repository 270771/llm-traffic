Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.116.11.97 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- No anomalies or heuristic references are explicitly provided, but by standard heuristic taxonomy, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in 133.247.37.158 through 133.247.242.212 range; destination IP is 3.116.11.97; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) on port 0 (ICMP does not use ports).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 3.116.11.97.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs in the 133.247.0.0/16 subnet exhibiting this behavior.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation or outage.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
