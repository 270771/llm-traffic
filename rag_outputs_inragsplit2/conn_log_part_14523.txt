Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood). Instead, they reference heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (other suspicious activity), neither related to ICMP or ping floods.  
- Heuristic 20 explicitly corresponds to ping flood detection, which is absent here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack indicated by heuristic 10 in anomaly_782, as SYN floods can cause denial of service similar to ping floods.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for SYN flood mitigation and monitor the source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 for further suspicious activity.  
- Confirm if ICMP traffic is being logged elsewhere or filtered out, as absence here may be due to logging configuration.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attack, indicating abnormal SYN packet activity.  
- Taxonomy 'ptmp' relates to partial TCP message patterns typical in SYN floods.  

No ping flood is detected; focus should be on the SYN attack anomaly for further investigation.
