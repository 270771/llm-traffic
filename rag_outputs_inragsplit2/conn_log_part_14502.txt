Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV or the logs.  
- The only anomaly present (anomaly_782) relates to source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, categorized as 'ptmp' with heuristic 10, which corresponds to a SYN attack, not a ping flood.  

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 indicates a SYN flood or SYN attack, characterized by many SYN packets without completing TCP handshakes.  
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' likely refers to partial or incomplete TCP connections, consistent with SYN flood behavior.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 further for potential SYN flood activity or scanning behavior.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect possible future ping flood attempts.  
- Verify if other logs (e.g., ICMP-specific logs) show suspicious ICMP traffic not captured here.
