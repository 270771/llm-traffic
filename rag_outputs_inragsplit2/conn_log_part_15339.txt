Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All Zeek conn.log entries show TCP or UDP traffic; no ICMP traffic is present in the snippet.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV or visible in the logs.  
- The only anomaly present is heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, categorized as 'ptmp' (partial TCP connection), indicating a SYN flood or SYN scan rather than a ping flood.  

Recommendation:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) further by monitoring TCP SYN packets from 89.3.89.164 on port 8080.  
- Confirm if this is a SYN flood or reconnaissance attempt and apply rate limiting or firewall rules accordingly.  
- Continue monitoring for ICMP traffic to detect any future ping flood attempts.
