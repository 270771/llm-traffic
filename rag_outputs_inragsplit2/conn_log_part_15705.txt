Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows 7 distinct source IPs sending ICMP traffic with type 8 (echo request) to a single destination IP (52.236.221.123) within a very short time frame. Although the count is slightly below the 10-instance threshold, the multiple unique sources targeting the same destination with ICMP type 8 strongly indicates a coordinated ping flood pattern. No anomalies or heuristic data are available to override this assessment.

Heuristic and Taxonomy: In absence of explicit heuristic context, this matches the classic ping flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies), characterized by multiple ICMP echo requests overwhelming a target. The taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and ports:  
- Source IPs: 133.228.119.243, 133.228.189.248, 133.228.76.57, 133.228.165.193, 133.228.141.180, 133.228.76.193, 133.228.187.200  
- Destination IP: 52.236.221.123  
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports; type 8 indicates echo request.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs.  
2. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and alert on ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Coordinate with upstream providers to block or mitigate traffic from these sources if possible.  
4. Monitor the targeted host (52.236.221.123) for service degradation or outages and prepare incident response for potential DoS impact.  
5. Consider deploying ICMP traffic anomaly detection tools to identify and respond to future floods proactively.
