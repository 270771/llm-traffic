Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 18.158.38.252 from multiple source IPs in the 157.161.x.x range. This volume and pattern of ICMP type 8 packets from many sources to one target matches the classic distributed ping flood attack pattern.
- The anomaly CSV identifies an anomaly (anomaly_53) targeting 18.158.38.252 with heuristic 20, which corresponds exactly to a ping flood attack according to the heuristic context.
- The taxonomy class "ntscICecrqICecrprp" aligns with NetworkScanICMP anomalies, consistent with ICMP-based scanning or flooding.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.161.35.192, 157.161.254.217, 157.161.250.145, etc.) sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 18.158.38.252. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.161.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host 18.158.38.252 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IPs to identify potential compromised hosts participating in the attack.
  5. Update intrusion detection/prevention systems with signatures for this ping flood pattern to detect and mitigate future attempts.

This is a confirmed ping flood attack per heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class NetworkScanICMP, requiring urgent mitigation to protect the targeted host.
