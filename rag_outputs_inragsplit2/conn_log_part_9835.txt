Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct source IPs all sending ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets to a single destination IP (3.215.122.104) within the same second, which matches the classic pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- ICMP type 8 is the only type present, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume (more than 10 instances) and the multiplicity of sources targeting one destination strongly indicate a coordinated flooding attempt.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known for detecting volumetric ICMP floods) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 157.17.76.171, 157.17.221.214, 157.17.188.237, etc.)
- Destination IP: 3.215.122.104
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Deploy network-level filtering to drop excessive ICMP traffic targeting 3.215.122.104.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with upstream providers to trace and mitigate attack sources.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic if the attack volume threatens network stability.
- Alert incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral attacks.
