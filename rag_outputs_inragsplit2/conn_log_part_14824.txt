Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 34.37.79.118, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomalies were explicitly found in the anomaly CSV, but the volume and concentration of ICMP type 8 packets from many different source IPs to a single destination strongly align with heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.24.25, 133.247.50.85, 133.247.255.45) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 34.37.79.118. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 34.37.79.118.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing and consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
  4. Monitor network performance and logs for continued or escalating ICMP flood activity.
  5. Notify the affected system owners and prepare for potential mitigation escalation such as upstream filtering or DDoS protection services.
