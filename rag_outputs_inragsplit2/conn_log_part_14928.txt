Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (3.116.11.97) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.45.57, 133.247.45.249, 133.247.126.120, etc.) all targeting destination IP 3.116.11.97 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 3.116.11.97.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse, as they appear to be part of a coordinated attack.
  3. Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.
  5. Monitor the target host for service degradation or outages and prepare mitigation plans such as blackholing or sinkholing if the attack escalates.
