Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: Although multiple ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present from source IP 52.42.116.124 to various destination IPs, the total count of such packets in the snippet is fewer than 10, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower this threshold.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests, possibly network scanning or legitimate pinging, but not flooding.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packet frequency or volume from these IPs. Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect if the pattern escalates into a flood. Investigate the source IP 52.42.116.124 for unusual behavior if the volume grows.
