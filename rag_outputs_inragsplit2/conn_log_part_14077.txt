Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 18.11.193.42, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- All ICMP types in these entries are 8, confirming these are ping requests, not other ICMP types.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x and 130.197.x.x ranges are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 18.11.193.42 on ICMP protocol (no ports).
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter for traffic destined to 18.11.193.42. Block or throttle the identified source IPs if possible. Monitor for continued ICMP flood activity and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks. Notify network operations to investigate potential compromised hosts in the source IP ranges.
