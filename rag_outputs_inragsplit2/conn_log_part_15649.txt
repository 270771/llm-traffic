Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: All ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) are fewer than 10 distinct instances from the same source IP to the same destination IP, and no known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present (no anomaly data found). The ICMP type is correctly 8, but the volume and repetition do not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided data. Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs to multiple destinations or repeated requests to a single destination exceeding the threshold. Correlate with anomaly data when available to detect heuristic 20 or other relevant heuristics.
