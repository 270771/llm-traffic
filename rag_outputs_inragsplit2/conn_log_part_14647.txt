Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from `133.247.49.34` to `195.196.104.26` with a single instance in the snippet. There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types 3, 13, and 0, which are not Echo Requests and thus not indicative of ping floods.  
- The anomaly record references a suspicious connection to `45.136.197.42` on port 46280 with heuristic 999 and taxonomy 'mptmp', but this does not relate to ICMP type 8 or ping floods.

No ping flood is detected. The anomaly with heuristic 999 and taxonomy 'mptmp' likely indicates a different suspicious multi-port or multi-protocol behavior, which should be investigated separately.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the anomaly involving `45.136.197.42` for potential multi-port scanning or other suspicious activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to confirm or rule out future ping flood attempts.
