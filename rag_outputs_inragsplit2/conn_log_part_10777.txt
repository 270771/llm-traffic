Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 69.47.69.34 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame to one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources targeting the same destination, which is met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple sources in the 133.247.0.0/16 range sending ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to destination IP 69.47.69.34. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet 133.247.0.0/16 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the target host 69.47.69.34 for service degradation or outages.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or participation in a botnet.
  4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting to catch future events early.
  5. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or mitigate attack traffic if it persists.
