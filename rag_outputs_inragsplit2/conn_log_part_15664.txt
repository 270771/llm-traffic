Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (from 157.17.111.62 and 157.17.63.180 to 35.169.51.96), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry (from 203.78.180.123 to 180.138.31.46) is type 1 (ICMP type not 8), so it does not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have appeared in other logs or alerts with suspicious behavior.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of ICMP flooding emerges over time.
