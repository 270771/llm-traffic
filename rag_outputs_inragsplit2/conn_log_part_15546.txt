Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP connection record shows ICMP type 11 (code 11 in the 4th and 6th fields is 11 and 0 respectively, indicating ICMP type 11, which is "Time Exceeded"), not type 8 (Echo Request). Only one instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single ICMP Time Exceeded message. Further investigation could include monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets or other ICMP types that might indicate scanning or reconnaissance.
