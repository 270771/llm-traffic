Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for a ping flood must be type 8 (Echo Request).  
- In the snippet, only three entries have ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (3 and 11) are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP messages without flooding characteristics.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Investigate the sources 161.139.96.135 and 202.124.53.30 for unusual ICMP activity patterns.  
- Collect more data or anomaly records to apply heuristics if available.
