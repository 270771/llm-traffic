Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 34.25.134.27 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, which is the required type for ping flood detection.
- Multiple unique source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet are sending ICMP Echo Requests to the same destination IP, indicating a distributed ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (known for ping flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources (e.g., 133.247.249.209, 133.247.180.158, 133.247.249.251, etc.) targeting destination 34.25.134.27 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from suspicious source IP ranges (133.247.0.0/16).
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests targeting internal hosts.
- Monitor the affected host 34.25.134.27 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources involved in the attack.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources for possible mitigation or blackholing.
- Consider deploying ICMP anomaly detection tools to alert on future ping flood attempts.
