Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is **not** happening.

Reasoning:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The heuristics present (10, 999) relate to SYN attacks and heavy hitters, not ping floods.
- The heuristic 20 specifically requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs flagged under heuristic 20, neither of which are found here.

Other potential attacks:
- Several anomalies relate to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitter behavior (heuristic 999), indicating possible TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.
- For example, anomaly_782 and anomaly_2012 are categorized as 'ptmp' under heuristic 10, which stands for SYN attack.
- These should be investigated further for potential TCP SYN flood or port scanning.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IPs flagged under heuristic 10 (e.g., 89.3.89.164) for SYN flood or scanning behavior.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for ICMP Echo Requests to confirm absence of ping flood.

In conclusion, no ping flood attack is detected based on the provided data. The current anomalies point to SYN-based suspicious activity (heuristic 10, SYN attack).
