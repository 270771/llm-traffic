Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV does not list any anomalies related to ICMP or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).  
- The heuristics present in the anomaly CSV relate mostly to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitters (heuristic 999), none indicating ping flood activity.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping flood detection, which requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets.  
- The anomalies here are categorized under SYN attack (heuristic 10) and other heavy hitter categories, unrelated to ICMP flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect any potential ping floods.  
- Enable ICMP logging or use packet capture tools to verify if ICMP Echo Requests are present in volume.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or anomalies flagged under heuristic 20 in future logs.
