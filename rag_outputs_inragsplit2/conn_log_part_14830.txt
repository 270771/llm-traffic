Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type observed in the snippet is type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 0 (Echo Reply), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, and none are present here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The observed ICMP traffic appears to be normal control messages rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs and anomaly data to enable heuristic-based detection.
