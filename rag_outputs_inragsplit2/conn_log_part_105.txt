Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 18.158.38.252 within a very short time frame, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, satisfying the requirement that only ICMP type 8 traffic is considered for ping flood detection.
- The number of ICMP type 8 instances exceeds the threshold of 10, confirming the volume is sufficient to indicate flooding.
- The anomaly CSV identifies an anomaly (anomaly_53) targeting the same destination IP 18.158.38.252, categorized under heuristic 20, which corresponds exactly to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class "ntscICecrqICecrprp" aligns with NetworkScanICMP anomalies, consistent with ping flood behavior.
- Source IPs are multiple (e.g., 157.161.161.255, 157.161.73.113, 157.161.241.169, etc.), indicating a distributed or multi-source flood targeting destination IP 18.158.38.252 on ICMP (port 0).

**Security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 18.158.38.252.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IP addresses involved in the flood (all listed 157.161.x.x addresses).
- Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other network logs to detect if this is part of a larger distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) campaign.
- Notify the network operations team to prepare for potential service degradation or outage on 18.158.38.252.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically targeting ICMP flood patterns matching heuristic 20.

This attack matches heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class NetworkScanICMP, confirming the nature and severity of the incident.
