Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP types in the snippet are type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, there are only 4 instances of ICMP type 8 in the provided snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic matches (such as heuristic 20) are present to override the instance count requirement.  
- The traffic does not show excessive volume or rapid repetition indicative of flooding.

Since no anomalies or heuristics are provided, no other attack type can be confidently inferred from this data.  

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of the involved IPs (78.116.131.149, 61.175.151.116, 35.100.170.152) appear in other logs with suspicious behavior.  
- Collect more data to verify if a pattern of ping flooding emerges.
