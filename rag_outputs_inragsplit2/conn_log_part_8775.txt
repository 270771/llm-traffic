Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time window, indicating a high volume of ping requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The source IP 44.61.12.164 is repeatedly sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range, suggesting a coordinated flood from a single source.
- Other source IPs (e.g., 133.247.x.x and 157.17.x.x) are also sending ICMP type 8 packets to 52.42.116.124 and 54.212.29.159, indicating multiple potential attackers or a distributed ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

**Involved IP addresses and ports:**
- Source IPs: 44.61.12.164, 133.247.135.209, 133.247.43.193, 133.247.157.244, 157.17.110.39, 157.17.110.62, 133.247.56.124, 157.17.5.193, 133.247.56.193, 133.247.157.255, 133.247.83.198, 133.247.55.243, 133.247.231.165, 133.247.27.170, 157.17.68.42, 133.247.23.143, 133.247.149.114
- Destination IPs: 163.252.243.187, 163.252.237.196, 163.252.237.228, 163.252.234.147, 163.252.234.10, 163.252.93.72, 52.42.116.124, 54.212.29.159
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs, especially 44.61.12.164.
- Deploy network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) or firewalls with DoS protection enabled.
- Block or throttle traffic from suspicious source IPs at the perimeter firewall.
- Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or secondary attacks.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source of the flood and consider upstream provider coordination to block malicious traffic.
- Review and update ICMP handling policies to prevent similar attacks in the future.
