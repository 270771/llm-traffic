Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 3, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type 8 ("Echo Request") required for ping floods.  
- There are only 2 ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not available here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP type 3 messages could indicate network issues or scanning activity but do not constitute a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of ICMP type 3 messages to determine if there is misconfiguration or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or volume spikes that might indicate a future ping flood attempt.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
