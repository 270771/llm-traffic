Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any IPs or ports related to ICMP or heuristic 20 (ping flood).
- The heuristics present (10, 999) relate to SYN attacks and heavy hitters, not ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks (TCP SYN flood).
- Heuristic 999 corresponds to "Other" or unknown anomalies.
- No heuristic 20 (ping flood) anomalies are detected.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN flood anomalies further (heuristic 10) as they indicate potential TCP SYN flood attacks.
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any ping flood attempts.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to confirm or rule out ping floods.
