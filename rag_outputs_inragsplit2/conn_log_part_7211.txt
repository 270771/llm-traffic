Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 50.239.214.145 from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources (e.g., 157.17.67.95, 157.17.69.254, 157.17.230.129, etc.) targeting destination IP 50.239.214.145 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the attack vector.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (157.17.0.0/16) to the victim IP 50.239.214.145.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and consider blacklisting persistent offending IPs.
- Notify network operations to investigate potential compromised hosts within the 157.17.x.x range.
- Deploy or tune DDoS mitigation tools to absorb or deflect the ICMP flood traffic.
- Conduct a post-incident review to identify root cause and improve detection heuristics for future attacks.
