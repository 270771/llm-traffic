Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.190.120.127 from multiple source IPs within the 133.7.x.x subnet. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to one target is characteristic of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, which matches the requirement for ping flood detection.
- The anomaly CSV references heuristic 20, which corresponds to "Ping flood" in the heuristic context, and the taxonomy class "icmp_error" aligns with the nature of ICMP-based flooding attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources (e.g., 133.7.168.236, 133.7.44.0, 133.7.199.36, etc.) targeting destination IP 52.190.120.127 on ICMP (port 0).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet 133.7.0.0/16 to the victim IP 52.190.120.127.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other network logs to detect possible amplification or distributed attack sources.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
  4. Alert incident response team to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
  5. Review and update ICMP handling policies to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic.

This attack matches heuristic 20 ("Ping flood") and taxonomy class "icmp_error" as per the anomaly CSV and heuristic context.
