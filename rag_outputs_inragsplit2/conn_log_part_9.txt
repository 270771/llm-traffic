Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) originating predominantly from source IP 133.16.14.149 to multiple destination IPs, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack (ICMP type 8 required, and at least 10 instances present).
- The anomaly CSV identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds exactly to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class associated is "icmp_error," which aligns with abnormal ICMP traffic patterns typical in ping floods.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149; Destination IPs include 173.50.207.4, 2.213.116.4, 23.230.102.5, 104.121.134.1, 195.7.182.17, 23.79.121.251, 23.176.156.5, 104.83.91.251, 96.199.190.3, 23.89.24.252, 184.204.169.251, 104.119.100.250, 184.167.143.100.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the attack vector.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
2. Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP anomalies from this and related IPs.
3. Conduct a forensic analysis on the source host 133.16.14.149 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
4. Implement ICMP rate limiting network-wide to prevent similar volumetric attacks.
5. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or distributed attacks.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack as defined by heuristic 20 and classified under the "icmp_error" taxonomy.
