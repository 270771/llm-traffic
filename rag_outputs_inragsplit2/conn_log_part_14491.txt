Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in any anomaly records.
- The anomalies present relate mostly to TCP SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and other categories unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.

The anomalies detected (e.g., anomaly_2012 and anomaly_772) correspond to heuristic 10, which stands for SYN attacks, indicating possible TCP SYN flood or scanning activity, not ping floods.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies further by reviewing connection attempts and TCP flags to confirm if a SYN flood or scanning is occurring.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Verify if any hosts are generating excessive SYN packets or exhibiting scanning behavior.

No ping flood is detected at this time.
