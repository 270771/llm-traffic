Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 139.179.133.57 to destination 203.78.173.46, and there is only one such instance.  
- Other ICMP entries are type 11 (Time Exceeded) or type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which are not relevant to ping floods.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristics are indicated.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attacks.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from any source IP.  
- Investigate the single ICMP type 8 instance if it recurs or correlates with other suspicious activity.  
- Review network baseline to confirm normal ICMP traffic patterns.
