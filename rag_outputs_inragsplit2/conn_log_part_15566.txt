Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV records. The anomalies present relate to heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (heavy hitter), none of which indicate ICMP or ping flood activity.  
- The anomaly taxonomy classes shown are 'ptmp' (point-to-multipoint SYN attack) and 'heavy_hitter', unrelated to ICMP flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) further, as they indicate suspicious TCP SYN traffic that could be a SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Collect and analyze ICMP-specific logs or packet captures to confirm if any ICMP-based attacks occur.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential future ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP connection attempts.  
- Taxonomy 'ptmp' refers to point-to-multipoint attack patterns, often seen in SYN floods or scanning.  
- No evidence of heuristic 20 (ping flood) or ICMP anomalies is present in the data.
