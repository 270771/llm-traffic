Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows values 0, 8, and 11, but only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) is present (at timestamp 1641099672.191521).  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.  
- The other ICMP types (0 = echo reply, 11 = time exceeded) do not indicate a ping flood.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP echo requests over a longer time window or correlating with other logs to detect stealthy or low-rate ICMP-based attacks.
