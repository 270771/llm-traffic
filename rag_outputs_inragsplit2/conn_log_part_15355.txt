Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- The anomalies present relate to heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (other), neither of which correspond to ping flood behavior.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packets.
- Heuristic 999 is a catch-all for other anomalies not fitting known categories.
- No heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is triggered here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IP 45.136.197.42 flagged in anomaly_1442 for potential multi-port scanning or other TCP-based attacks.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.
- Verify if any ICMP traffic is filtered or logged elsewhere to ensure no ping flood is missed.
