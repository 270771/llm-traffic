Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the log entries shows values 8, 3, and 11. Only type 8 corresponds to an ICMP echo request (ping).  
- There are only two entries with ICMP type 8 (from IPs 13.74.134.236 and 203.78.177.156). The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.  
- The other ICMP types (3 = destination unreachable, 11 = time exceeded) do not indicate ping flood activity but could be normal network error messages.

No heuristic or taxonomy from anomaly data applies here due to lack of anomalies. No further investigation for ping flood is needed. However, monitoring for increased ICMP echo requests or other anomalies is recommended if traffic volume changes.
