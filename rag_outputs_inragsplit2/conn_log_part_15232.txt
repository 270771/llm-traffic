Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type for ping requests (echo requests) must be 8. In the snippet, there are only 4 entries with ICMP type 8 (lines with src IPs 173.235.215.97 and dst IPs 163.252.46.x, and two entries with src 133.247.49.34 and dst 204.133.135.84 and 23.200.90.3).
- The total count of ICMP type 8 entries is fewer than 10, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.
- Other ICMP types present (0, 3, 11) indicate different ICMP message types (echo reply, destination unreachable, time exceeded), not ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages may indicate normal network diagnostics or routing issues, not an attack.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential future ping floods.
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 11 messages if unusual network behavior is observed.
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify anomalies in future analyses.
