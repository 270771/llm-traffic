Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records reference heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (other), but none mention heuristic 20 (Ping flood).
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN flood attacks, which aligns with the TCP SYN flags seen in the conn.log entries (S0 state).
- Therefore, the traffic matches a SYN flood pattern rather than a ping flood.

Heuristic and taxonomy explanation:
- Heuristic 10 indicates a SYN attack, characterized by many TCP SYN packets without completing the handshake.
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' (point-to-point) is assigned to anomaly_782, consistent with SYN flood behavior.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 flagged in anomaly_782 for potential SYN flood activity.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic to detect possible ping floods in the future.
- Review firewall and intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to mitigate SYN flood attacks.
