Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (35.173.100.241) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations in a short time frame.
- Assigning heuristic number 20 (commonly associated with ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" is appropriate given the pattern.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.173.100.241; Destination IPs include 163.252.242.176, 163.252.103.224, 163.252.250.102, 163.252.244.81, and many others as listed.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 35.173.100.241 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on internal or external hosts receiving the flood.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to prevent recurrence.
- Notify upstream providers or relevant CERT teams if the source IP is external and malicious.
