Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type values other than 8 (the ICMP type field is not explicitly shown, but the count of ICMP type 8 packets is zero or very low).
- Each connection log entry shows only a single ICMP packet (count = 1), which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The entries show isolated ICMP traffic with no signs of flooding or scanning.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packet counts from the same source IPs.
- Collect and analyze ICMP type fields explicitly to confirm packet types.
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in future anomaly reports or heuristic matches.
