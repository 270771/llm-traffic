Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only once in the snippet (at timestamp 1641099674.124548).  
- Other ICMP types present are 11 and 3, which are not Echo Requests and thus not relevant to ping floods.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume over a longer period or checking other logs for related anomalies.
