Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time window, indicating a high volume of ping requests.
- The rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.182.167, 157.17.61.28, 133.247.96.195, 157.17.175.202, etc.) targeting a few destination IPs (notably 157.187.159.183 and 3.118.117.235) matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms a target with ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP type 8 packets) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x and 157.17.x.x ranges sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs 157.187.159.183 and 3.118.117.235. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
  
**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources of the flood.
- Engage with upstream ISP providers to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or services to automatically respond to such attacks in the future.
