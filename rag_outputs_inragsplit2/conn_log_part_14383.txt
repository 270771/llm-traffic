Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connections but no ICMP traffic entries.
- ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods, and none are present in the logs.
- The UDP entries have protocol number 17 but are associated with ports like 1900, 53, 6881, which are typical for other services (e.g., SSDP, DNS, BitTorrent), not ICMP.
- The anomaly record references a suspicious connection to 45.136.197.42 on port 46280 but is categorized under heuristic 999 with taxonomy 'mptmp', which does not correspond to ICMP or ping flood heuristics.
- Without ICMP type 8 packets or at least 10 such instances, no ping flood pattern is detected.

Recommendation:
- Investigate the anomaly_1442 further as it may indicate a multi-protocol or multi-target probing attack (mptmp).
- Review network traffic for ICMP packets separately to confirm no stealthy ICMP-based attacks.
- Monitor the suspicious IP 45.136.197.42 for unusual activity, as it appears in the anomaly record.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- Heuristic 999 corresponds to 'mptmp' (multi-protocol multi-target probing), indicating suspicious scanning or probing behavior, not a ping flood.
