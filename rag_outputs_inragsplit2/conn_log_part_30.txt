Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets within a very short time frame, originating from multiple source IPs such as 133.16.14.149, 3.159.134.162, 52.164.38.38, and others, targeting various destination IPs. This pattern of rapid ICMP Echo Requests matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack. The taxonomy class assigned is "icmp_error," which aligns with ICMP-based DoS attacks.
- Involved IP addresses include:
  - Source IPs: 133.16.14.149, 3.159.134.162, 52.164.38.38, 157.78.69.33, among others.
  - Destination IPs: 104.72.62.8, 149.56.151.220, 163.210.13.58, 163.210.17.249, 163.210.36.249, etc.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8 (Echo Request), confirming the ping flood nature.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs, especially 133.16.14.149.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Monitor network traffic for further anomalous ICMP activity and correlate with other logs to identify potential botnet involvement.
  4. Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources for possible upstream filtering.
  5. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is restricted to necessary use cases only.

This attack matches heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and the taxonomy class "icmp_error" indicating an ICMP-based denial-of-service attack.
