Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 52.236.221.123, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm a target.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume (more than 10 instances) of ICMP type 8 packets in a short time frame strongly indicates a ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet and others are sending ICMP Echo Requests to destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16 and others observed).
- Deploy network-level filtering or firewall rules to drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets targeting 52.236.221.123.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with upstream providers to trace and mitigate attack sources.
- Consider activating DDoS mitigation services or appliances to absorb and filter malicious ICMP traffic.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation or outage.
