Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.230.228.52) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is clearly met here.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is heuristic 20 (based on the promptâ€™s mention), which typically relates to volumetric ICMP flood attacks. The taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the nature of overwhelming ICMP traffic.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.0.0/16 subnet (e.g., 133.247.107.195, 133.247.137.249, 133.247.19.27, etc.) targeting destination IP 52.230.228.52 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
  2. Monitor the target host (52.230.228.52) for service degradation or outages.
  3. Engage upstream ISP or cloud provider to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic upstream if possible.
  4. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts within the 133.247.0.0/16 subnet that may be participating in the attack.
  5. Prepare incident response to mitigate impact and collect forensic data for attribution.
