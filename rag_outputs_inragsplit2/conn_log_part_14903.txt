Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows values 8, 3, and 10. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There are only 3 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet (lines with src ports 8), which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 10 = Router Advertisement) do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 and 10 messages may be normal network behavior or unrelated ICMP traffic.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of the source IPs (3.70.110.240, 139.179.133.57, 128.253.31.181) show repeated ICMP Echo Requests exceeding the threshold in a larger dataset.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection tools to identify potential reconnaissance or scanning activity.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be assigned at this time.
