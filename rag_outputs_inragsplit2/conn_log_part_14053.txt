Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows 10 distinct ICMP connections all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 68.104.133.69 within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where multiple sources send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is met here.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range (e.g., 133.228.217.204, 133.228.160.134, 133.228.131.197, etc.) all targeting destination IP 68.104.133.69 on ICMP type 8.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
  2. Monitor the target host 68.104.133.69 for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in blocking or mitigating the flood traffic closer to the source.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests matching this pattern.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
