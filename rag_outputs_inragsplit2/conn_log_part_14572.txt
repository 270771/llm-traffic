Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

This traffic does not match ping flood patterns but may indicate traceroute or TTL expiration activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific attack classification can be assigned.

No immediate attack response is needed; however, monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP errors from these IPs could be a prudent next step.
