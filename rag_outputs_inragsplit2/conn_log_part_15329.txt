Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is a single occurrence between 130.197.190.210 and 54.16.160.215.  
- The other ICMP entry has type 3, which is not type 8 and thus not part of a ping flood.  
- The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets to indicate a ping flood is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if 130.197.190.210 or 54.16.160.215 appear in future anomaly reports or logs with higher ICMP echo request counts.
