Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 3 and 13, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, and in fact, none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.

Since ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 13 (Timestamp Request) are observed, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns but may indicate other network diagnostics or error messages. Without heuristic or anomaly data, no further attack classification is possible.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IPs if unusual volumes of ICMP type 3 or 13 persist, as they may indicate network scanning or misconfigurations.
