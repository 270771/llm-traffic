Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 139.179.133.57 to destination 203.78.173.102, but there is only 1 instance, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which does not qualify as a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are matched, no further immediate action is required. However, continued monitoring of ICMP traffic volume and patterns is recommended to detect any escalation.
