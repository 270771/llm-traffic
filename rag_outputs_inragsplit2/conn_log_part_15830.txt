Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting IP 52.236.221.123 and a few others, indicating multiple sources sending ICMP echo requests rapidly to the same destination(s). This matches the known ping flood pattern of overwhelming a target with ICMP type 8 packets.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy is provided in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP flood attack pattern. Assigning heuristic 20 (as per your instructions for known ping flood detection) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" is appropriate.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs including 157.17.27.73, 157.17.232.177, 157.17.232.1, 133.247.33.196, 157.17.27.92, 157.17.22.193, 157.17.171.193, 157.17.221.214, 157.17.23.235, 61.1.51.193, 157.17.221.242, 133.247.87.26, 157.17.18.152, 157.17.99.131 targeting destination IP 52.236.221.123 primarily, all on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the targeted IP 52.236.221.123 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these sources are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic upstream if attack volume escalates.
- Alert incident response team to prepare for potential escalation or collateral attacks.
