Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This exceeds the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The traffic pattern involves multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.x.x and 157.17.x.x ranges) sending ICMP type 8 packets to a small set of destination IPs (notably 3.118.117.235 and 157.187.159.183), consistent with a distributed ping flood targeting specific hosts.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses include multiple sources from 133.247.39.105, 133.247.185.29, 157.17.0.71, 157.17.24.61, among others, targeting destination IPs 3.118.117.235 and 157.187.159.183. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on network devices (firewalls, routers) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention systems (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the targeted hosts for service degradation or outages and prepare to isolate affected systems if necessary.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources of the flood.
- Engage with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.
