Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This meets the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The connections target a single destination IP, 54.29.238.156, from multiple source IPs mostly in the 157.17.x.x range, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- All entries are ICMP type 8, confirming these are ping requests, not other ICMP types.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but based on standard taxonomy, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but source IPs include multiple hosts (e.g., 157.17.163.14, 157.17.70.193, 157.17.68.42, etc.) targeting destination 54.29.238.156.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests targeting 54.29.238.156 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS).
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (157.17.0.0/16) if they are not expected to legitimately ping the destination.
- Monitor for collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic and adjust thresholds accordingly.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying an anti-DDoS service or cloud-based mitigation if the attack volume escalates.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral attacks.
