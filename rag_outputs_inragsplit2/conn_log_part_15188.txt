Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.229.78.71, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the count exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood in absence of known anomalous IPs.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard taxonomy, this fits heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and one in 223.129.196.121 sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.229.78.71 on ICMP protocol (no ports for ICMP).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP echo requests at the network perimeter targeting 54.229.78.71.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (133.247.0.0/16 and 223.129.196.121) if they are not legitimate users.
- Monitor for continued ICMP flood attempts and consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) with DoS mitigation capabilities.
- Notify the network operations team to investigate potential compromise or misuse of the source IPs.
- If possible, apply geo-blocking or access control lists (ACLs) to restrict ICMP traffic to trusted sources only.
