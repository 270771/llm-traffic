Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the destination IP 3.30.218.60. Specifically, there are at least 10 distinct connections from different source IPs (e.g., 133.240.255.205, 133.240.251.57, 133.240.120.130, etc.) all sending ICMP type 8 packets to 3.30.218.60, which matches the requirement of at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 for a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV identifies an anomaly (anomaly_58) involving destination IP 3.30.218.60, categorized under heuristic 20, which corresponds exactly to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class "ntscICecrqICecrprp" is a variant of "NetworkScanICMP" (prefix "ntscIC"), consistent with ICMP-based scanning or flooding activity.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.240.x.x range targeting destination IP 3.30.218.60 on ICMP (port 0).
- This traffic pattern—multiple ICMP Echo Requests from various sources to a single destination—matches the classic ping flood attack heuristic (heuristic 20) and taxonomy class NetworkScanICMP.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests targeting 3.30.218.60.
2. Investigate the source IPs (133.240.x.x range) for potential compromise or participation in a botnet.
3. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs to detect distributed denial-of-service escalation.
4. Notify the owner of 3.30.218.60 to prepare for potential service degradation and consider deploying an upstream DDoS mitigation service.
5. Update intrusion detection/prevention systems with signatures for heuristic 20 to automate future detection and response.

This is a confirmed ping flood attack as per heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class NetworkScanICMP, supported by both the log data and anomaly records.
