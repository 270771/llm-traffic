Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are two isolated instances from different source IPs (157.17.23.59 and 139.179.133.57) to different destinations.  
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets in total, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP traffic (type 3 and 1) are not Echo Requests and thus not relevant to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 1 (Host Unreachable) messages may indicate normal network error reporting rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to identify suspicious patterns.
