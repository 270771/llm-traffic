Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows 11 distinct ICMP connections all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 161.67.57.135 within a very short time frame, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs (157.17.230.129, 157.17.109.214, 157.17.212.69, 157.17.212.96, 157.17.239.120, 157.17.45.231, 157.17.239.172, 157.17.250.173, 157.17.250.56, 157.17.230.198, 157.17.189.153) all targeting destination IP 161.67.57.135 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs.
- Monitor the target host 161.67.57.135 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to identify if this is part of a larger distributed attack.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the attack sources for possible mitigation.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests matching this pattern.
