Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.237.221.62, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The volume and concentration of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs to one destination strongly indicate an attempt to overwhelm the target with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a typical ping flood heuristic, which can be assigned heuristic number 1 (ICMP flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range; destination IP: 52.237.221.62; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request); ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.237.221.62.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if possible.
  5. Monitor network and host performance for signs of degradation or service impact.
