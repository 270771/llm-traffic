Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet appears to be the 4th column (values like 11, 8, 11, 8). ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping).
- There are only two entries with ICMP type 8 (lines 2 and 4), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest exceptions or known suspicious IPs that would lower the threshold.
- The other ICMP types (11) correspond to Time Exceeded messages, which are not related to ping floods.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The lack of anomaly records and heuristic context means no further classification is possible.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IPs.
- Investigate the source IPs 203.78.177.156 and 183.10.118.115 if ICMP Echo Requests increase.
- Collect more detailed logs or packet captures to verify if a ping flood or other ICMP-based attack emerges.
