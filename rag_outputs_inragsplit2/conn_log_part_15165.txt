Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 35.127.34.186 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so no explicit heuristic or taxonomy is given. By default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.127.34.186 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 35.127.34.186 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any signs of service degradation on the destination IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts or systems that may be launching this attack.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or mitigating traffic from the attacker IP.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools to catch future occurrences early.
