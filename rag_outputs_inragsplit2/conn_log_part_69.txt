Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) originating predominantly from source IP 133.16.14.149 to multiple destination IPs. This satisfies the condition of having at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, indicating repetitive ping requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class assigned is "icmp_error," which aligns with the nature of ICMP echo request floods causing anomalous ICMP traffic.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 133.16.14.149; multiple destination IPs including 104.97.89.248, 23.88.95.2, 23.235.49.250, 80.152.62.162, 23.79.4.7, 66.111.198.13, 104.93.165.254, 23.82.189.253, 193.37.174.168, 23.86.116.252, 23.68.51.4, 92.139.92.255, 204.171.80.32, 23.90.237.252.
- Ports are ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), port fields are zero or not applicable.

**Security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
2. Conduct a forensic investigation on the host with IP 133.16.14.149 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or related DoS activity.
5. Implement ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to prevent recurrence.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack as per heuristic 20 and the "icmp_error" taxonomy class.
