Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type values of 3 or 11, none have type 8, which is required for echo request (ping) packets.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.  
- ICMP types 3 and 11 correspond to destination unreachable and time exceeded messages, which are not indicative of a ping flood but could be related to network issues or other ICMP-based diagnostics.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. However, the presence of multiple ICMP type 3 and 11 messages from the same source IP (203.65.114.222) to various destinations may warrant further investigation into possible network scanning or misconfiguration.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for unusual behavior or misconfigured devices.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic or other suspicious patterns.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems once heuristic and taxonomy data become available.
