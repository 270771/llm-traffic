Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) from a single source IP (54.254.250.38) to many different destination IPs within a very short time frame. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, satisfying the threshold for a ping flood.
- The pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where a single host sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm multiple targets or a network segment.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy data is provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous ICMP flood behavior) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.254.250.38; Destination IPs include 163.252.105.252, 163.252.64.116, 163.252.64.119, 163.252.183.114, 163.252.105.193, 163.252.202.218, 163.252.82.223, 163.252.236.71, 163.252.115.74, 163.252.236.121, 163.252.201.201, 163.252.255.185, 163.252.201.253, 163.252.115.92, 163.252.255.184, 163.252.202.54, 163.252.115.93, 163.252.98.6.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8 (Echo Request).

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.254.250.38 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network devices for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts or lateral movement originating from 54.254.250.38.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security appliances.
- Notify the incident response team to investigate the source host for potential compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to block malicious traffic if the source is external.
