Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 12 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 16.160.152.89 from multiple source IPs within the 133.228.x.x subnet. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests in rapid succession to one target matches known ping flood attack behavior.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting a single victim IP.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources (133.228.248.8, 133.228.189.248, 133.228.124.6, 133.228.89.92, 133.228.210.185, 133.228.84.206, 133.228.220.7, 133.228.124.86, 133.228.170.6, 133.228.196.1, 133.228.196.198, 133.228.251.193) targeting destination IP 16.160.152.89 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests directed at 16.160.152.89.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic from the identified source IP range.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and consider blacklisting persistent offending source IPs.
- Notify the network operations team to investigate potential compromised hosts within the 133.228.x.x subnet.
- If possible, temporarily disable ICMP Echo Requests to the affected host until the attack subsides.
