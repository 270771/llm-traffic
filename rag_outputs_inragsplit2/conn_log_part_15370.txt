Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV records; all anomalies relate to heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (heavy hitter), which do not indicate ICMP or ping flood activity.  
- The anomalies detected involve suspicious TCP ports and SYN flags, consistent with SYN flood or scanning activity, not ICMP flooding.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packets.  
- Taxonomy classes like 'ptmp' and 'heavy_hitter' relate to connection patterns and volume but not ICMP flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN anomalies further for potential SYN flood or scanning attacks.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to promptly identify ping floods.
