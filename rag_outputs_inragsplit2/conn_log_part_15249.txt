Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic, but only one instance is present. The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here. No anomaly data or heuristic context is available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from the single connection log entry. Further investigation should include monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential flooding.
