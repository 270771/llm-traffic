Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.237.185.15, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources to one destination) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.237.185.15 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.237.185.15.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs in the 157.17.x.x subnet.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
