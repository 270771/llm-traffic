Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The provided Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.  
- Since ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods and none are logged here, the criteria for a ping flood are not met.  
- No anomalies related to ICMP or heuristic 20 (Ping flood) appear in the anomaly CSV records. The anomalies listed correspond to heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (heavy hitter), which are unrelated to ping floods.  

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping flood detection, which requires ICMP type 8 packets in sufficient quantity (â‰¥10) or known anomalous IPs flagged under heuristic 20. Neither condition is met here.  
- The anomalies present relate to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitter behavior (heuristic 999), indicating possible TCP SYN flood or volumetric scanning, not ICMP flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) further by reviewing TCP SYN packet rates and connection attempts from the suspicious IPs (e.g., 89.3.89.164 on port 8080).  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Confirm if any hosts are experiencing service degradation consistent with SYN flood or other TCP-based DoS attacks.
