Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 8 (from the port fields), but the first entry shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). The second entry shows ICMP type 8 but only a single instance is present.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 11 packets are part of a traceroute or other legitimate diagnostic traffic.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out potential ICMP-based attacks.
