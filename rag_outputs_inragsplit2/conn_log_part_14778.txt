Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (163.171.168.73) with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP Echo Requests to multiple destination IPs strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests from a single source) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP: Source IP 163.171.168.73 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs (e.g., 163.252.131.229, 163.252.24.194, 203.78.188.32, etc.). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 163.171.168.73 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to identify compromise or misuse.
  3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and implement alerting for excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services if the attack persists.
