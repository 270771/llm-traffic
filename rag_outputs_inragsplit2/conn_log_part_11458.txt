Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 52.181.17.215 from multiple different source IPs within the 133.228.x.x subnet. This pattern of multiple sources sending ICMP Echo Requests in rapid succession to a single target matches the classic distributed ping flood attack behavior.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.228.171.200, 133.228.79.254, 133.228.79.249, etc.) all sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.181.17.215. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Assigning heuristic number 20 (common heuristic for ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" as the most likely labels based on standard ping flood attack classification.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16).
2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets targeting 52.181.17.215.
3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the affected host for service degradation or outages.
4. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from persistent offending IPs if the attack volume escalates.
5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet for further remediation.
