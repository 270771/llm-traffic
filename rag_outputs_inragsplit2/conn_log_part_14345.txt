Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 13.242.241.56 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection criteria specify at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances suffice to confirm a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not indicated here).
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 13.242.241.56 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be launching the attack.
- Implement ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future patterns.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious traffic source for potential mitigation.

Heuristic assignment: Heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) is the most relevant taxonomy class for this attack type.
