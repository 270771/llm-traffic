Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 3 or 11, none have type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) indicates error or diagnostic messages, not ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

Since no ping flood is detected, no heuristic or taxonomy related to ping floods applies here. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP error messaging or traceroute-like activity.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the cause of the high volume of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages, as excessive ICMP errors can indicate network misconfigurations or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect potential ping floods.
