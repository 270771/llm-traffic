Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (13.211.197.216) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple hosts with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) commonly used to identify ping floods.
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 13.211.197.216; Destination IPs include 203.78.183.46, 203.78.177.205, 203.78.177.109, 203.78.183.57, 203.78.177.107, 203.78.186.195, 203.78.176.162, 203.78.178.104, 203.78.178.242, 203.78.184.183, 203.78.184.33, 203.78.148.51, 203.78.186.54, 203.78.184.1; ICMP does not use ports, so port is 0.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 13.211.197.216 at the network perimeter firewall to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor network devices and hosts for signs of degradation or outages caused by the flood.
- Conduct a threat intelligence lookup on 13.211.197.216 to assess if it is a known malicious actor.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in IDS/IPS systems.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to stop the attack closer to the source.
