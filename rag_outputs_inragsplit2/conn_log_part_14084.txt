Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.193.126.151) within a very short timestamp window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type 8 is the only type involved, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume and concentration of these requests from multiple source IPs to one destination IP strongly indicate an ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic #20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range are flooding the destination IP 54.193.126.151. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking rules on the firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to drop ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Monitor the destination host (54.193.126.151) for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic closer to the source.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or enabling existing DDoS protection services.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts and remediate accordingly.
