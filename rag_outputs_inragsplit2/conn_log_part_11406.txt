Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from two source IPs (54.183.76.138 and 3.122.197.179) targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- The pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests sent in a short time frame to multiple targets is consistent with a distributed ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood detection: ICMP type 8 with at least 10 instances.
- The most likely heuristic number is 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood), and taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Source IPs: 54.183.76.138, 3.122.197.179
- Destination IPs: Multiple in 163.252.7.x, 163.252.90.x, 163.252.150.x, 163.252.181.x, 163.252.194.x, 163.252.242.x, 163.252.250.x, etc.
- ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and block ICMP flood patterns from these sources.
- Notify network operations to monitor for service degradation or outages on the targeted subnets.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the source IPs if they are known malicious or not part of legitimate traffic.
- Conduct a forensic review of upstream logs and firewall data to identify if these IPs are part of a larger botnet or coordinated attack.
- Prepare to escalate to incident response if service impact is detected or attack volume increases.
