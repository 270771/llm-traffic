Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet show only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) traffic (indicated by the count of 1 in the second record). The first record does not specify ICMP type 8 and has zero ICMP packets.  
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.  
- The traffic pattern does not match a ping flood but could be normal or isolated ICMP traffic.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for increased ICMP echo request counts over time from these IPs.  
- Checking for any related anomalies in other logs or alerts that might indicate reconnaissance or scanning activity.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific classification can be assigned at this time.
