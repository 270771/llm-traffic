Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 18.98.73.236, from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests flooding one target matches the classic ping flood attack signature.
- The anomaly CSV confirms this with two relevant anomalies involving the destination IP 18.98.73.236 and source IP 133.16.14.149, both categorized under heuristic 20, which explicitly corresponds to "Ping flood" in the heuristic context.
- The taxonomy classes involved are "mptmp" (MultiPoints) and "icmp_error" (Other), indicating multiple sources targeting one destination with suspicious ICMP traffic.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources from the 130.90.x.x subnet and 133.16.14.149, all targeting destination IP 18.98.73.236. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as unknown or zero.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 18.98.73.236.
  2. Investigate and isolate the source IPs (130.90.x.x range and 133.16.14.149) to identify if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
  3. Deploy intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures tuned to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
  4. Monitor network traffic for further anomalous ICMP activity and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
  5. Notify affected stakeholders and prepare for potential escalation if the attack persists or expands.
