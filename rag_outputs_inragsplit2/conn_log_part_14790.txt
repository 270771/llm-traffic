Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 35.119.5.36 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard practice, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.119.5.36 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 35.119.5.36 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on internal hosts in the 163.252.x.x subnet.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source host 35.119.5.36 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting to catch similar future events early.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack if it persists.
