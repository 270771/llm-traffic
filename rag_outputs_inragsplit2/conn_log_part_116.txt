Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8. In the snippet, only a few entries have ICMP type 8 (e.g., lines with src IP 54.222.0.254 and 54.212.218.127).  
- The total count of ICMP type 8 packets is fewer than 10, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP types present (type 11, 0, etc.) do not correspond to echo requests and thus are not indicative of ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and type 0 (Echo Reply) packets may be normal network diagnostic traffic.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 11 packets if unusual network behavior is observed, as these may indicate traceroute or other diagnostic activity.  
- Collect and correlate additional logs or anomaly data to identify any emerging patterns.
