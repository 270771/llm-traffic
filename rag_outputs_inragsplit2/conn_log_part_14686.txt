Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains no ICMP traffic entries with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.
- All entries are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP packets are logged here.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any IPs or ports related to ICMP or ping flood heuristics (heuristic 20).
- The heuristics present (10 and 999) correspond to SYN attacks and other suspicious traffic, not ping floods.
- Therefore, no evidence supports a ping flood attack.

Next steps:
- Investigate anomalies with heuristic 10 (SYN attack) further, as SYN floods can also cause denial of service.
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 packets in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Verify if any other logs (e.g., ICMP-specific logs) show suspicious ICMP traffic.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packets.
- Heuristic 999 is a catch-all for other suspicious traffic not fitting known categories.

No ping flood is detected; focus should be on SYN anomalies and continued monitoring for ICMP traffic.
