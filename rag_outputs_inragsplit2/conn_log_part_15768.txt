Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All Zeek conn.log entries are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present in the snippet.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly record references a suspicious connection to 45.136.197.42:46280 but categorizes it as 'mptmp' with heuristic 999, unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.
- Without ICMP type 8 packets and at least 10 instances, the criteria for ping flood detection are not met.

Recommendation:
- Investigate the anomaly involving 45.136.197.42 further, as it may indicate another type of suspicious activity (heuristic 999, taxonomy 'mptmp' likely stands for multi-port/multi-protocol scanning or probing).
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests from or to suspicious IPs.
