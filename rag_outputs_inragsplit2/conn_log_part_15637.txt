Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from source IP 16.172.102.121 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) commonly used to detect ping floods.
- Taxonomy class: Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IP: Source IP 16.172.102.121 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 16.172.102.121 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools to catch recurrence early.
