Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows mostly values other than 8 or missing for some entries. Only two entries have ICMP type 8 as the source port (which is unusual but corresponds to ICMP echo request), but there are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 overall.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or any other heuristic.  
- The traffic does not exhibit the volume or pattern consistent with a ping flood attack, which requires at least 10 ICMP echo requests (type 8) from the same or multiple sources targeting a destination.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are matched, no further immediate action is required for ping flood detection.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased ICMP echo request counts from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate the unusual use of ICMP type 8 in source port fields for some entries, as this may indicate malformed or suspicious traffic.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
