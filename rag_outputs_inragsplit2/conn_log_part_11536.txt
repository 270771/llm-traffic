Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 34.25.134.27 from multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to one target is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- All ICMP types are 8, satisfying the requirement that only type 8 indicates ping flood attempts.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.181.245, 133.247.229.48, 133.247.177.245, etc.) targeting destination IP 34.25.134.27 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host 34.25.134.27 for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims or sources to contain the attack spread.
