Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 11 and 8 in the source port field, but these do not correspond to ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) in the expected ICMP type field. The conn.log snippet does not explicitly show ICMP type 8 for these packets.  
- There are only 2 ICMP connection entries total, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the count threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if more comprehensive ICMP traffic logs exist to verify if a larger volume of ICMP type 8 packets is present.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs to detect potential ping floods.  
- Enable detailed ICMP type logging to confirm packet types explicitly.
