Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IPs (notably 54.29.238.156 and 13.86.47.233) from multiple distinct source IPs, consistent with a volumetric ping flood pattern.
- The absence of anomaly CSV records means no explicit heuristic or taxonomy is provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP ping flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses include multiple sources such as 157.17.125.26, 133.247.237.185, 157.17.159.41, and others sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs 54.29.238.156 and 13.86.47.233. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Notify network operations to monitor for service degradation on the targeted hosts.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking source IP ranges if they are known malicious or irrelevant to business operations.
  5. Conduct a post-incident review to identify if any internal hosts are compromised or participating in the attack.
