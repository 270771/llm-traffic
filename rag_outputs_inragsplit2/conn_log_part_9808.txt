Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic consists exclusively of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are the hallmark of ping flood attacks.
- There are more than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time frame, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with flooding behavior.
- Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.29.235, 133.247.243.54, 133.247.95.167, etc.) are targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 3.115.159.25 and 54.214.205.182), which is typical of distributed ping flood attacks.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but based on standard taxonomy, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."

**Involved IP addresses:**
- Sources: Multiple IPs in the 133.247.x.x range.
- Destinations: 3.115.159.25 and 54.214.205.182.
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
4. Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation and prepare to activate incident response procedures if service impact is detected.
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical infrastructure if not required for legitimate operations.
