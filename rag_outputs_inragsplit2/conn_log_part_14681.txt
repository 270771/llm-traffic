Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown as type 8 (Echo Request) in the conn.log snippet. The ICMP traffic entries have a dash ("-") in the ICMP type fields, indicating no type 8 packets are confirmed.  
- Only two ICMP connection entries are present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances required to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches that would override the count requirement.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The connection states are "OTH" (other), which typically means incomplete or unusual connection states but not necessarily an attack.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made. However, the low volume and lack of ICMP type 8 evidence strongly indicate no ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing detailed ICMP packet types and counts to confirm the nature of ICMP traffic.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from these or other IPs.  
- Enable heuristic detection rules for ICMP floods if available in the monitoring system.
