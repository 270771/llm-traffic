Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 157.187.159.183 from multiple different source IPs within a very short time frame (~1641099664 timestamp). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where many echo requests overwhelm a single target.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources targeting one IP) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.247.35.253, 133.247.50.151, 133.247.143.190, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 157.187.159.183 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8, confirming echo requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host 157.187.159.183 for service degradation or outages and consider isolating it if impact is severe.
- Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if other hosts are involved or compromised to participate in the flood.
- Notify upstream providers or peers to assist in filtering attack traffic closer to the source.
