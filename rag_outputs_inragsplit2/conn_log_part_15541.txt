Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- All Zeek conn.log entries are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present in the snippet.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The only anomaly record (anomaly_782) relates to a SYN attack (heuristic 10) on port 8080 from source IP 89.3.89.164, which is unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.
- Heuristic 20 (ping flood) is not triggered or referenced in the anomaly CSV.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) on 89.3.89.164:8080 further, as SYN floods can cause denial of service.
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs specifically to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from suspicious IPs to apply heuristic 20 if conditions are met.
