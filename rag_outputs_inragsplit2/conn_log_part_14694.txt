Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 11, 8, and 3. Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.
- The other ICMP types (11 = Time Exceeded, 3 = Destination Unreachable) do not correspond to ping flood traffic.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports related to heuristic 20 or other heuristics.
- The traffic pattern does not match a ping flood, which requires multiple ICMP echo requests targeting a host in a short time frame.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. Further investigation could include monitoring for repeated ICMP echo requests or other suspicious traffic patterns over a longer time window.
