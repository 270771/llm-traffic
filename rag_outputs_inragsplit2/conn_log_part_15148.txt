Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

This traffic does not match ping flood patterns but may indicate normal ICMP error messaging. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no further classification is possible.

No attack is detected; no immediate action is required. However, monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from or to these IPs could be a prudent next step.
