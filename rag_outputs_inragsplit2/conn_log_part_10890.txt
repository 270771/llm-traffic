Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP event, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this log entry. The ICMP type 3 message typically signals network or host unreachable conditions, which is normal network behavior rather than an attack.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Collect more comprehensive logs and anomaly data to enable heuristic-based detection.
