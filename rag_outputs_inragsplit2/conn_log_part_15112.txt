Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 11 distinct ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets sent to the same destination IP 54.29.238.156 from multiple different source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern of multiple ICMP echo requests flooding a single target matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the presence of more than 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination strongly aligns with the heuristic that requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances to confirm a ping flood.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.111.190, 157.17.98.40, 157.17.105.251, etc.) are flooding destination IP 54.29.238.156 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (echo request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP echo requests at the network perimeter targeting 54.29.238.156.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are not legitimate users.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs to identify potential botnet or coordinated attack sources.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks automatically.
- Notify the network operations team to investigate the affected host 54.29.238.156 for potential service disruption or compromise.
