Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (in fact, none), so the threshold for ping flood detection is not met.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP type 11 traffic may be related to traceroute or routing issues, which is normal or benign in many cases.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for unusual ICMP type 11 traffic patterns or volume spikes.  
- Monitor for any emergence of ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious activity.  
- If heuristic 20 or other heuristics become available, re-evaluate with that context.
