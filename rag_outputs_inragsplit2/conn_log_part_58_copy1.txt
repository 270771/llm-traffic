Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: The only ICMP type 8 (echo request) instance is from source IP 157.161.144.242 to destination 115.232.239.120, and there is only one such instance in the snippet. All other ICMP entries have type 0 or other values, which do not qualify as ping flood traffic. The threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets is not met.

However, anomaly_102 flags traffic to 115.232.239.120 with heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood. This suggests that the destination IP 115.232.239.120 is known to be involved in suspicious ICMP echo request traffic elsewhere, but the current snippet does not show sufficient evidence of a ping flood.

Heuristic 20 stands for "Ping flood" detection based on abnormal ICMP echo request volume or known suspicious IPs. The taxonomy class "ntscICecrqICecrprp" relates to NetworkScanICMP anomalies involving echo request/reply patterns.

Next steps: Investigate additional logs or longer time windows for increased ICMP type 8 traffic involving 115.232.239.120 or other suspicious IPs. Correlate with network flow data to confirm if a ping flood is occurring. Monitor for repeated ICMP echo requests exceeding the threshold.
