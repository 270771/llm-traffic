Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.169.51.96) within a very short time window, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Each connection is from a different source IP, indicating a distributed ICMP Echo Request flood aimed at overwhelming the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of 10 or more ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination, which is clearly met here.
- The taxonomy class is consistent with a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range; destination IP: 35.169.51.96; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request); no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 35.169.51.96.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges (133.247.0.0/16) if they are not trusted.
- Monitor network devices and host 35.169.51.96 for signs of resource exhaustion or service degradation.
- Engage upstream ISP or DDoS mitigation services to filter or absorb the flood traffic.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or compromised hosts.
