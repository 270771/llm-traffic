Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (13.242.241.56) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) commonly used to identify ping floods.
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IP: Source IP 13.242.241.56; Destination IPs include multiple 163.252.x.x addresses; ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request), port 0.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on internal hosts receiving the ICMP flood.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Notify upstream providers if the source IP is external to coordinate mitigation.
