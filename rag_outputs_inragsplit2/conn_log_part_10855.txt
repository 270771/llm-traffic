Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The ICMP type in the relevant entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- However, there are only 4 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest these IPs are known suspicious sources or destinations.  
- The traffic pattern does not show the volume or frequency typical of a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned confidently.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo request frequency from these or other IPs.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect if these IPs become suspicious.  
- Investigate the source IP 52.250.47.198 for unusual behavior if it continues sending ICMP requests.
