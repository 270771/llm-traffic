Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 44.61.26.217 from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior matches a classic ping flood heuristic: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession aimed at overwhelming the target.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.255.54, 133.247.61.189, 133.247.117.37, etc.) targeting destination IP 44.61.26.217 on ICMP type 8 (no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy or tune intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Monitor the target host 44.61.26.217 for service degradation or outages.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to block or filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.

This is a clear case of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
