Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 52.236.221.123 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy is provided in the anomaly CSV for this exact pattern, the behavior aligns with a denial-of-service attack heuristic typically numbered around 20 in common taxonomies (reflecting ICMP flood attacks).
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x and 133.228.x.x ranges; destination IP is 52.236.221.123. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.236.221.123.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
  4. Monitor network traffic for continuation or escalation of the attack and prepare to engage upstream providers for traffic filtering if needed.
