Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type values of 3 and 10, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.  
- ICMP type 3 indicates "Destination Unreachable," and type 10 indicates "Router Advertisement," which are normal control messages, not flooding attempts.

No known heuristics or taxonomy classes apply here due to lack of data.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate why these ICMP control messages are present; frequent destination unreachable messages may indicate network misconfiguration or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or volume spikes that could indicate a developing ping flood.
