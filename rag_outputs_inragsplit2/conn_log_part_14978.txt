Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from 157.17.161.131 to 143.52.88.224, but it has zero recorded instances (count 0), indicating no actual ping requests were sent.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 1 (Destination Unreachable), which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, and no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to override this threshold.

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no taxonomy classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect repeated ICMP Echo Requests.  
- Investigate if the ICMP type 1 messages indicate network issues or misconfigurations.
