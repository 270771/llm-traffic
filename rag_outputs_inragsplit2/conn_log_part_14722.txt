Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains no ICMP traffic entries, only TCP and UDP connections.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV only references an anomaly with heuristic 10 (SYN attack), unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.
- Heuristic 20 corresponds to ping flood, but no such heuristic or related anomalies appear in the data.

Recommendation:
- Investigate further by capturing ICMP traffic specifically to monitor for ICMP type 8 packets.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for any ICMP anomalies.
- Continue monitoring for SYN flood attacks as indicated by heuristic 10 in the anomaly CSV.
