Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 8, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet (139.179.133.57 â†’ 203.78.173.249).
- The other ICMP types (3 = Destination Unreachable, 11 = Time Exceeded) do not indicate ping floods.
- The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not present here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 and 11 messages may indicate normal network error reporting.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.
- Investigate if 139.179.133.57 or 203.78.173.249 appear in future logs with repeated ICMP Echo Requests.
- Collect more data to apply heuristics once available.
