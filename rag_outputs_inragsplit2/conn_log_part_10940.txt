Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (35.173.100.241) from multiple distinct source IPs within a very short time frame.
- There are at least 11 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, exceeding the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood unless known anomalous IPs are involved (none are indicated).
- This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where an attacker overwhelms a target with numerous echo requests to degrade service or cause denial of service.
- Although no explicit heuristics or taxonomy data is provided, the most relevant heuristic would be heuristic 20 (related to ICMP flood detection), and the taxonomy class would be "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet (e.g., 157.17.66.234, 157.17.158.183, 157.17.161.227, etc.) targeting destination IP 35.173.100.241 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable for ICMP).
  
Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests targeting 35.173.100.241 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range (157.17.66.0/24 and related subnets) if they are not legitimate users.
- Monitor for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs for potential coordinated attacks.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services if the attack persists.
