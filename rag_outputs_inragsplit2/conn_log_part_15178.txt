Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.229.78.71 within a very short timestamp window. This pattern of multiple ICMP Echo Requests from many different source IPs to one destination is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.229.78.71 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.229.78.71.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if appropriate.
  4. Monitor network performance and logs for signs of service degradation or collateral impact.
  5. Notify relevant incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or follow-up forensic analysis.
