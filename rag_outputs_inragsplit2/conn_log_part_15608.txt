Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of this ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest otherwise.

This traffic does not match ping flood patterns but could indicate traceroute or TTL expiration activity. Without heuristic or taxonomy context, no specific attack classification applies here.

No immediate attack is detected; however, monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from this or other IPs is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
