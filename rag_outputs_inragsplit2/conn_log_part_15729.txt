Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- Only one instance of each ICMP type is present, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding or DoS by themselves.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these ICMP error messages correlate with other network issues or scanning activity.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
