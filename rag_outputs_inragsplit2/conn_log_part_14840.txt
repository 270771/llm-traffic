Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (such as heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic does not show a high volume or rapid repetition typical of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if the volume of ICMP echo requests rises above the threshold.  
- Investigate the behavior of IPs 133.247.173.120 and 133.247.75.118 if they continue sending ICMP echo requests to 34.37.79.118.
