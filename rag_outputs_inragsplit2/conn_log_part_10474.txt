Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP traffic in the log shows a single instance with ICMP type 11 (code 0), which is a Time Exceeded message, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP packet is recorded, far below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.

No anomalies or heuristics are present in the provided data to suggest another attack type. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP diagnostic or error messages.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if future logs show repeated ICMP Echo Requests exceeding the threshold.
