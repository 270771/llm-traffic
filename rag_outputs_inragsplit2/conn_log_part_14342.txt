Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (13.242.241.56) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods is heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
- Involved IP: Source IP 13.242.241.56 is the attacker; destination IPs are multiple hosts in the 163.252.x.x range; ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is the attack vector.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
  3. Notify affected network owners of the destination IPs.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools (e.g., IDS/IPS signatures, rate limiting).
  5. Conduct a broader network scan to identify if other hosts are involved or targeted.

This is a clear and active ping flood attack requiring urgent mitigation.
