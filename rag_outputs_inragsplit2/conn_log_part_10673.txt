Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.178.233.150 from multiple source IPs within the 130.197.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (130.197.150.45, 130.197.55.195, 130.197.158.21, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.178.233.150 on ICMP type 8 (no ports involved as ICMP is layer 3).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (130.197.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  3. Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host 54.178.233.150 for service degradation or outages.
  4. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if the attack persists.
  5. Conduct further investigation to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or spoofed addresses.
