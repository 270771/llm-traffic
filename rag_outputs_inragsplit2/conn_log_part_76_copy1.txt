Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.76.120.97) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from one source targeting many destinations in a short time frame.
- The involved IP address is the source 163.76.120.97 sending ICMP echo requests to various destination IPs (e.g., 163.21.24.0, 203.65.112.138, 163.21.3.231, etc.). ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic originating from 163.76.120.97 at the network perimeter firewall to prevent further flooding.
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the source host 163.76.120.97 for compromise or misuse.
- Monitor network traffic for similar ICMP floods from other sources.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) with ICMP flood signatures.
- Notify affected destination networks if possible to prepare for potential impact.
