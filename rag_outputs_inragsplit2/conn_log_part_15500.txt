Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 11 and 3, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) suggest normal network error or diagnostic traffic rather than an attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes.  
- Investigate if these ICMP error messages correlate with any network issues or misconfigurations.  
- If future logs show multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination exceeding 10 instances, re-evaluate for ping flood using heuristic 20 if applicable.
