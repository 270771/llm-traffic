Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from two source IPs: 3.122.197.179 and 54.183.76.138, targeting multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- The volume and rapid succession of these echo requests to many different targets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies), which flags high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic from a single source to multiple destinations.
- Involved IP addresses:  
  - Sources: 3.122.197.179, 54.183.76.138  
  - Destinations: Multiple 163.252.x.x IPs  
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs (3.122.197.179 and 54.183.76.138) at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other network logs to detect possible amplification or lateral movement.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious IPs to assist in mitigation.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as ICMP flood filters or anomaly-based IDS signatures.
- Conduct a post-incident review to ensure no internal hosts are compromised and to update firewall rules accordingly.
