Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) from source IPs 16.212.151.163 and 133.16.14.149 to various destination IPs. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, satisfying the threshold for ping flood detection.
- The anomaly CSV identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack. The taxonomy class is "icmp_error," consistent with ICMP-based flooding.
- Involved IP addresses include:
  - Source IPs: 16.212.151.163, 133.16.14.149
  - Destination IPs: multiple, including 163.210.183.6, 163.210.231.251, 163.210.17.249, 23.176.84.0, 104.77.154.3, 54.77.221.233, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8, confirming echo requests.
- This matches heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class "icmp_error" indicating an ICMP-based denial-of-service attack.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs (16.212.151.163 and 133.16.14.149).
2. Deploy intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures tuned to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
3. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to identify potential amplification or distributed sources.
4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source hosts for compromise or misuse.
5. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if the source IPs are external and not part of legitimate network operations.

This targeted response will mitigate the ongoing ping flood attack and reduce the risk of denial-of-service impact.
