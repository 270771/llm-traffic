Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 11 and 3, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only three ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not imply flooding or DoS activity here.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these ICMP type 3 and 11 messages correlate with network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Collect heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
