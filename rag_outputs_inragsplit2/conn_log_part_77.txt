Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 129.43.87.6 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets match the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where a single source floods multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- The anomaly CSV identifies heuristic 20 as "Ping flood" and classifies related anomalies under "icmp_error," which aligns with this detection.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 129.43.87.6 sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs ranging from 163.210.95.25 through 163.210.95.63 on ICMP port 0 (ICMP does not use ports, but the field is 0).
- The anomaly record for source IP 133.16.14.149 with heuristic 20 is unrelated here since it does not match the main source IP of the flood.

**Security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from 129.43.87.6 at the perimeter firewall to prevent further flooding.
2. Monitor network devices for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance caused by the flood.
3. Investigate the source host 129.43.87.6 for compromise or misconfiguration that may be causing the attack.
4. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in intrusion prevention systems (IPS).
5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or lateral movement.

This is a clear ping flood attack as per heuristic 20 ("Ping flood") and taxonomy class "icmp_error" indicating ICMP-based denial-of-service activity.
