Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of this ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of 10 required to consider it a flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

This traffic does not match ping flood patterns but could indicate traceroute or TTL expiry activity. Without heuristic context or anomaly data, no further classification is possible.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if ICMP type 11 traffic spikes abnormally, as it may indicate network issues or reconnaissance.
