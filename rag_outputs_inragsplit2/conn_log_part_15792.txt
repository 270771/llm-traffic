Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 52.236.221.123 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the signature of ping requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly or heuristic data is provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) commonly used to identify ping floods.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to the nature of ICMP flooding.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP with type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with network performance degradation.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) or rate-limiting on routers.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source and potential compromise.
- Consider blacklisting the source IP if it is confirmed malicious and not part of legitimate network operations.
