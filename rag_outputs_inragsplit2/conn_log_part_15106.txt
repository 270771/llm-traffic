Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (13.86.47.233) from multiple source IPs within a very short time window (~0.003 seconds). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where many echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 13.86.47.233 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- The most likely heuristic number is 20 (common heuristic for ICMP flood detection), and the taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
2. Monitor the target host (13.86.47.233) for service degradation or outages.
3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic closer to the source.
4. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are compromised hosts or part of a botnet and remediate accordingly.
