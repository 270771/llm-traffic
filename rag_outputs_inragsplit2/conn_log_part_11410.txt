Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request packets (ICMP type 8) originating primarily from 54.183.76.138 targeting numerous destination IPs within the 163.252.x.x range. There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets in a very short time window, consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The absence of anomaly CSV records means no explicit heuristic or taxonomy is provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.76.138 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs (e.g., 163.252.240.22, 163.252.78.244, 163.252.201.253, etc.). Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from 54.183.76.138 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
  3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential compromise or misuse of the source host.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or enabling ICMP rate limiting on affected hosts and network devices.
  5. Review upstream provider filtering options to prevent further attack traffic.
