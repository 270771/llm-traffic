Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 128 and 8. ICMP type 128 corresponds to Echo Reply, not Echo Request (type 8). Only one instance of ICMP type 8 is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would override the count threshold.  
- The traffic does not match the known pattern of a ping flood, which requires multiple (â‰¥10) ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source or to the same destination.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source or to the same destination.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving these IPs or ICMP traffic patterns.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs and anomaly data to enable heuristic-based detection.
