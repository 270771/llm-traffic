Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present but only 3 distinct instances are logged, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the instance count threshold.  
- The other ICMP types present (e.g., type 10) do not correspond to ping requests and thus are irrelevant for ping flood detection.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from the same source IPs to the same destination IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems to identify if these IPs exhibit suspicious behavior over time.  
- Investigate if the destination IP 3.116.11.97 is experiencing any service degradation or network issues that might be related to ICMP traffic.
