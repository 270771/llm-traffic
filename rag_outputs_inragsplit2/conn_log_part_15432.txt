Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 16.160.194.189 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are echo requests, which are used in ping floods.
- Multiple source IPs from the 130.197.x.x subnet are sending these requests, indicating a distributed or coordinated flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (known for ping flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: multiple sources (130.197.154.60, 130.197.154.234, 130.197.60.125, etc.) targeting destination 16.160.194.189 on ICMP type 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP echo requests at the network perimeter to block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
- Monitor the target host 16.160.194.189 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to block or mitigate traffic if the flood volume escalates.
