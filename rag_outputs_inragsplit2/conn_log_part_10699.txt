Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection log entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.206.231.130 from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known from your instructions as related to anomalous source or destination IPs in ping floods) and fits the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.101.7, 157.17.239.120, 157.17.254.17, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.206.231.130. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.206.231.130.
  2. Identify and isolate the source IPs involved in the flood for further investigation and potential blocking.
  3. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
  4. Notify incident response team to prepare for potential denial-of-service impact and consider upstream provider assistance for traffic filtering.
