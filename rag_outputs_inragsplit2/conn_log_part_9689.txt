Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.152.76.54) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern matches a distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests simultaneously to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods is triggered by at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.0.0/16 range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.152.76.54 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host (54.152.76.54) for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to filter or block malicious ICMP traffic closer to the source.
  4. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse to prevent further participation in the attack.
  5. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns automatically.
