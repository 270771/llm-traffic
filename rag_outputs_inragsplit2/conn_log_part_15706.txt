Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.236.221.123) within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- All ICMP types are 8, which is the required type for ping flood detection.
- No anomaly records are present, so by default, heuristic 20 (known anomalous IPs) does not apply.
- The most likely heuristic number is 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range are flooding the destination IP 52.236.221.123 with ICMP Echo Requests. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16) at the network perimeter firewall. Additionally, monitor the target host (52.236.221.123) for service degradation and consider deploying an intrusion prevention system (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks. Notify network operations to investigate potential compromised hosts within the source IP range.
