Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (13.242.241.56) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 13.242.241.56; Destination IPs include multiple 163.252.x.x addresses.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 13.242.241.56 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
- Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to alert on similar future events.
- Consider notifying upstream providers or relevant CERT teams if the source IP is external and persistent.
