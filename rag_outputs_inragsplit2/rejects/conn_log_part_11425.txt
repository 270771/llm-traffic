Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet shows only two entries with ICMP type 8 (echo request), both from source IP 54.183.76.138 to different destinations, with only one instance each.  
- The other ICMP entries have types 1, 3, or 10, which are not echo requests and thus not relevant to ping floods.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 overall, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristics (such as heuristic 20) are indicated in the anomaly CSV or heuristic context.  
- No anomaly records were found to suggest suspicious IPs or ports.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) and type 1 (echo reply) is normal in network operations.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from any single source IP.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP echo requests or anomalies in source IP behavior.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts if available to detect emerging threats.
