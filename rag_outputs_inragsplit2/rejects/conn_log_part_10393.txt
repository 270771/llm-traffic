Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  
- The ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) does not indicate a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without further anomalies or heuristic context, no immediate threat is detected.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential patterns.  
- Investigate if any of the involved IPs have a history of suspicious activity in other data sources.
