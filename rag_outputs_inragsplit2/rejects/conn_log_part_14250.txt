Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connections, but none explicitly indicate ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The protocol field in all entries is either UDP (17) or TCP (6); no ICMP (protocol number 1) entries are present.
- No entries show repeated ICMP type 8 packets or at least 10 instances from the same source to the same destination.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference heuristic 20 (Ping flood) but rather heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (heavy hitter), which are unrelated to ICMP ping floods.
- Heuristic 20 specifically flags ping floods, but no such heuristic or taxonomy is triggered here.

Next steps:
- Investigate further for SYN flood or other TCP-based DoS attacks, as heuristic 10 (SYN attack) is present in anomaly_782 and anomaly_2012.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Verify if UDP port 1900 traffic (seen repeatedly from 80.142.66.223) is legitimate or part of a UDP-based amplification attack, as it is suspicious but unrelated to ping floods.

In conclusion, no ping flood attack is detected; the current anomalies align with SYN flood heuristics (heuristic 10) and heavy hitter behavior (heuristic 999).
