Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are at least 10 distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets to the same destination IP 34.25.134.27 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic logic, this matches a classic ICMP ping flood (heuristic 20 typically relates to volumetric ICMP anomalies).
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.247.81.90, 133.247.92.44, 133.247.81.243, etc.) targeting destination IP 34.25.134.27 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic confirms the nature of the attack.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.81.0/24 and related subnets).
- Monitor the destination host 34.25.134.27 for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if they are confirmed malicious.
- Notify upstream providers if attack traffic volume is high to assist in mitigation.
