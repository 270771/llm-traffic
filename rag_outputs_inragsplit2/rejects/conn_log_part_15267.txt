Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) originating from the source IP 159.109.173.90 targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~0.0001 seconds between entries). This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where a single source rapidly sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (often heuristic 20 in many frameworks), characterized by high-frequency ICMP type 8 packets from a single source.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 159.109.173.90; Destination IPs include 202.194.58.107, 163.252.194.193, 163.252.158.0, 163.252.159.106, 163.252.159.126, 163.252.159.77, 163.252.156.1, 133.251.112.101, 133.251.113.41.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8, confirming echo requests.
- Security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 159.109.173.90 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network devices for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance.
  3. Conduct a forensic review of the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
  5. Implement or verify existing ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security appliances.
