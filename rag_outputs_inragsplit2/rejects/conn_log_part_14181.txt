Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 13, which corresponds to "timestamp request," not type 8 (echo request) required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP instances, fewer than the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Since ICMP type 13 is used for legitimate timestamp requests, these entries do not inherently indicate malicious activity.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 (echo request) traffic to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving known suspicious IPs or ports, especially if heuristic 20 or similar is identified.  
- Collect and correlate additional logs or anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
