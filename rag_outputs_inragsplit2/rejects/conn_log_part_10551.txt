Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have type values 3 and 13, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). ICMP type 8 is required for ping flood detection.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or alternative detection criteria.

Since no ping flood is detected and no other attack patterns are evident from the given data, no immediate security action is required. However, continued monitoring of ICMP traffic for type 8 packets and volume spikes is recommended to detect future ping flood attempts.
