Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 11 packets typically relate to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are other logs with ICMP type 8 packets or higher volume traffic from these IPs.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or anomalies related to these IPs.  
- If heuristic 20 or other heuristics become available, re-evaluate with that context.
