Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP traffic entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.  
- All entries are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP packets are logged here.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ping flood (heuristic 20) anomalies; the only heuristics mentioned are 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (other).  
- Heuristic 20 explicitly relates to ping flood attacks, which are absent in this data.

No other attack type is clearly indicated here either, though heuristic 10 (SYN attack) is noted for an anomaly involving source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, which suggests a possible SYN flood or scanning activity, not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the anomaly with heuristic 10 (SYN attack) further by reviewing TCP SYN packet rates and connection attempts from 89.3.89.164.  
- Monitor for any ICMP Echo Request traffic to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for more detailed ICMP traffic analysis.

Heuristic 10 stands for SYN attack, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packets possibly used in SYN flood or scanning. Taxonomy 'ptmp' indicates partial TCP message patterns consistent with such attacks.
