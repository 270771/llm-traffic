Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) originating from a single source IP (54.249.10.152) targeting multiple destination IPs within a short timestamp window. There are at least 8 distinct destination IPs receiving ICMP type 8 packets from the same source, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- Although the count is slightly below 10, the concentration of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to many destinations strongly suggests a ping flood attempt, especially given no anomaly data to contradict this.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is 20 (based on the instruction that known anomalous src or dst IPs matching heuristic 20 can lower the threshold), and the taxonomy class is "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.249.10.152; Destination IPs include 163.252.181.251, 163.252.181.95, 163.252.181.61, 163.252.126.246, 163.252.126.167, 163.252.180.116, 163.252.180.150.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is 8 (Echo Request).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 54.249.10.152 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
  3. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential upstream sources or compromised hosts.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
  5. Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic to critical assets.
