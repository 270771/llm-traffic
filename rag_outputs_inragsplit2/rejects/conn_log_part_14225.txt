Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is **not** happening.

Reasoning:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connections but **no ICMP traffic entries** at all.
- Specifically, there are no records with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.
- The UDP entries (protocol 17) are mostly on port 1900 (likely SSDP) and do not indicate ICMP.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP or ping flood heuristics; the only heuristics mentioned are 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (other suspicious traffic), neither related to ICMP or ping floods.
- Heuristic 20, which corresponds to ping flood, is not triggered or referenced in any anomaly.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 20 stands for ping flood attacks, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets.
- The anomalies present relate to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and unknown/miscellaneous anomalies (heuristic 999), unrelated to ICMP.

Next steps:
- Investigate the UDP traffic on port 1900 (SSDP) for potential amplification attacks, as these can be abused in DDoS scenarios.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for any ICMP traffic not captured here.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests to detect future ping floods.

No ping flood attack is detected in the provided data.
