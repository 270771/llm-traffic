Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. The traffic does not match known ping flood patterns such as repeated ICMP echo requests from the same source to the same destination.

No other attack type is indicated by this single connection log entry. Without additional data or anomalies, no further investigation is warranted specifically for ping floods. Monitoring for increased ICMP echo request volume from 130.197.63.32 to 173.235.245.195 is recommended as a next step if suspicious activity is suspected.
