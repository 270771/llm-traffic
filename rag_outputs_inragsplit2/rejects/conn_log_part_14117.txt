Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping), consistent with potential ping traffic.  
- However, only 3 instances of ICMP type 8 are present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to consider it a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower the threshold or confirm an attack.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests, possibly legitimate pings or scanning activity but not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo requests from the source IP 52.251.137.84 to multiple destinations.  
- Investigate if these IPs are known for scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- If more than 10 ICMP type 8 packets occur in a short time frame, re-evaluate for ping flood using heuristic 20 or other relevant heuristics once available.
