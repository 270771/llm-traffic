Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records reference heuristic 10 (SYN attack) on TCP ports 8080 and 26200, indicating SYN flood or similar TCP-based attacks, not ICMP ping floods.
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, and taxonomy class 'ptmp' likely stands for partial TCP malicious patterns.
- No evidence of heuristic 20 (Ping flood) or ICMP traffic is found in the data.

Next steps:
- Investigate the anomalous IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 and 185.102.240.231 on port 26200 for potential SYN flood or TCP-based DoS activity.
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs separately to confirm or rule out ping flood attacks.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect future ping flood attempts.
