Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets originating primarily from the IP 54.250.161.90 to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attackâ€”high volume ICMP Echo Requests aimed at overwhelming targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession from a single source to many destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.250.161.90 sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs 203.78.190.65, 203.78.181.174, 203.78.181.134, 203.78.186.195, 203.78.184.170, 203.78.184.224, 203.78.184.194, 203.78.179.32, and 203.78.187.187. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.250.161.90 at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs.
  3. Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) or DDoS protection services.
  5. Investigate the source IP for possible compromise or misuse.
