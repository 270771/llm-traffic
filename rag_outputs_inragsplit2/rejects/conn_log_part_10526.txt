Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 0, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP instances total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 0 (Echo Reply) are normal control messages and do not signify flooding or scanning.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate if future logs show repeated ICMP Echo Requests exceeding the threshold or matching known heuristics for ping floods.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging threats.
