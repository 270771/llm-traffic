Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest other attack types.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed. However, the presence of ICMP type 3 messages could warrant checking for network misconfigurations or scanning activity, but this is not indicative of a ping flood attack.
