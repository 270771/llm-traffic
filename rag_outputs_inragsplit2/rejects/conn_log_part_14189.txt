Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping), matching the required type for ping flood consideration.  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances needed to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators that would lower the threshold or confirm an attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without additional anomalies or heuristic context, these appear to be isolated ICMP echo requests rather than a flood.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs (161.67.42.226) to multiple destinations.  
- Investigate if these IPs have appeared in other logs with suspicious activity.  
- Collect more data to determine if a pattern emerges that meets the ping flood criteria or other attack heuristics.
