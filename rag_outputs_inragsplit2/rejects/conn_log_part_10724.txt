Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV only references an anomaly on TCP port 8080 (heuristic 10: SYN attack), unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.  
- Heuristic 20 (ping flood) is not triggered or referenced in the data.

The anomaly detected (heuristic 10) corresponds to a SYN attack, which involves TCP SYN packets used in connection flooding, not ICMP ping floods. This indicates suspicious TCP SYN traffic from source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, categorized as a partial TCP SYN flood or scan.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 for potential SYN flood or port scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests to detect future ping flood attempts.  
- Verify firewall and IDS rules to ensure SYN flood protections are active.
