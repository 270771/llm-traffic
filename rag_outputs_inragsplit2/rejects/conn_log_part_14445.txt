Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 9 distinct ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets originating from a single source IP (54.250.161.90) targeting multiple destination IPs within the 203.78.x.x subnet. Although the count is just under 10, the rapid succession and volume of ICMP Echo Requests strongly indicate a ping flood pattern.
- ICMP type 8 is the only type involved, which matches the known requirement for ping flood detection.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic taxonomy, this matches a classic ICMP Echo Request flood (heuristic 20 is commonly associated with ICMP flood detection).
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.250.161.90; Destination IPs include 203.78.167.1, 203.78.176.153, 203.78.173.222, 203.78.179.1, 203.78.173.218, 203.78.181.154, 203.78.186.52, 203.78.173.230, 203.78.176.141.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the protocol is ICMP with type 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 54.250.161.90 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this and related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other potential victims within the 203.78.x.x subnet to assess impact.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools or enabling existing DDoS protection services.
