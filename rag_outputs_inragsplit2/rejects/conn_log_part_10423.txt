Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (54.178.233.150) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send numerous echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a known heuristic for ping floods: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (echo requests) exceeding the threshold of 10 instances, targeting a single victim IP.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.11.65, 133.247.142.57, 133.247.58.32, etc.) sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.178.233.150 on ICMP protocol (port 0).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source subnet (133.247.0.0/16) to the victim IP.
  2. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic from these sources if the attack volume escalates.
  3. Monitor the victim host and network for signs of service degradation or further attack vectors.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically targeting excessive ICMP echo requests to prevent recurrence.
  5. Conduct forensic analysis on the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
