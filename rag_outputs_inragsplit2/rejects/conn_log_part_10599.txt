Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All Zeek conn.log entries are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present in the snippet.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV only shows one anomaly (ID anomaly_782) related to source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, categorized as 'ptmp' with heuristic 10, which corresponds to a SYN attack, not a ping flood.
- Heuristic 20 (ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly records.
- The traffic pattern shows multiple failed TCP connection attempts (S0 state), consistent with a SYN flood or scanning activity, not ICMP flooding.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 further for potential SYN flood activity, as indicated by heuristic 10.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect possible ping floods in the future.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for SYN flood signatures and consider rate limiting or blocking suspicious IPs.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 indicates SYN attack patterns (high number of SYN packets without completion).
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' relates to partial or incomplete TCP connections, consistent with SYN flood behavior.
