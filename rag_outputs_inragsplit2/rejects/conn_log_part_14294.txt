Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) sent from different source IPs (130.197.172.144, 130.197.172.151, 130.197.63.158, 130.197.190.249, 130.197.136.57) targeting a single destination IP (69.46.227.121). There are at least 5 distinct entries with ICMP type 8 within a very short time frame, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- Although the count is slightly below 10, the presence of multiple unique sources simultaneously sending ICMP type 8 packets to the same destination strongly suggests a distributed ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are available, but by standard heuristic logic for ping floods, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources targeting one destination).
- Taxonomy class: Network Denial of Service (DoS) via ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: Sources - 130.197.172.144, 130.197.172.151, 130.197.63.158, 130.197.190.249, 130.197.136.57; Destination - 69.46.227.121; Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Monitor the destination host (69.46.227.121) for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential sources of ICMP flood traffic.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if sources are from suspicious or unexpected regions.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
