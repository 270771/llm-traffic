Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP or ping flood-related heuristics; the closest heuristics are 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (other), neither related to ICMP.
- Heuristic 20, which corresponds to ping flood, is not triggered or referenced in the anomalies.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided data. The anomalies relate to suspicious TCP connections on ports 8080 and 46280, categorized as 'ptmp' and 'mptmp' respectively, with heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (other). Heuristic 10 indicates SYN flood or SYN scan activity, which should be investigated separately.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 for possible SYN flood or scanning activity, as indicated by heuristic 10.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further context on suspicious TCP traffic.
