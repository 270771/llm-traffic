Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The first entry shows ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), so it does not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- The second entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), but there is only one instance of this type, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The first entryâ€™s ICMP type 11 could be related to traceroute or routing issues, which is not an attack but may warrant network troubleshooting.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the source IP 202.194.17.61 sending ICMP type 11 packets if unusual network behavior is observed.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
