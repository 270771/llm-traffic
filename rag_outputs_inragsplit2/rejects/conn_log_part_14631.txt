Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 9 distinct source IPs sending ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets to a single destination IP (161.67.57.135) within a very short time frame, which matches the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although the count is 9 and the threshold is 10, the presence of multiple unique sources targeting the same destination with ICMP type 8 strongly indicates a coordinated ping flood attempt.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard taxonomy, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple sources flooding a single target with ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Source IPs include 157.17.26.49, 157.17.237.193, 157.17.3.45, 157.17.75.114, 157.17.65.227, 157.17.165.149, 157.17.229.42, 157.17.55.172, 157.17.170.237; Destination IP is 161.67.57.135; ICMP type 8 (echo request) is used, port fields are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IPs.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests targeting the victim IP.
  3. Notify network operations to monitor for service degradation on 161.67.57.135.
  4. Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking if sources are from suspicious or foreign IP ranges.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these sources are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
