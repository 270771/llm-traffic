Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connections but no ICMP traffic entries.  
- ICMP traffic would be indicated by protocol number 1, but all entries show protocols 6 (TCP) or 17 (UDP).  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV does not reference any ICMP-related anomalies or heuristics relevant to ping floods. The only anomaly listed (heuristic 999) is unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.  
- Without at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 or matching heuristic 20 anomalous IPs, the criteria for ping flood detection are not met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided data. The heuristic 999 in the anomaly CSV corresponds to an unspecified anomaly type ('mptmp'), which does not relate to ping floods or ICMP traffic.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further by capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic specifically to detect any potential ping floods.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) or unusual traffic patterns from suspicious IPs.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts that might indicate different attack vectors.
