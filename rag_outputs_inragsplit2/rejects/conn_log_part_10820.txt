Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded) or another non-type-8 ICMP message (since the ICMP type field is not explicitly given but the port is 0, indicating no echo request). There is only one instance of ICMP traffic, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets required to consider a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are present to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single connection log entry. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Monitor for increased ICMP echo request traffic from or to these IPs, and collect more connection logs to identify potential patterns or volume spikes indicative of flooding or other ICMP-based attacks.
