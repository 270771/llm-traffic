Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP connection record shows an ICMP type 8 (echo request), which is consistent with ping traffic. However, there is only one instance of this type in the snippet, far below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.

No other attack type is evident from the data provided. Without multiple repeated ICMP echo requests or additional anomalies, this traffic appears to be normal ping activity.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (210.122.60.57) to the destination (151.21.220.60). If the count reaches or exceeds 10 within a short time frame, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, gather heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
