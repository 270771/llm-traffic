Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 1, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, both with ICMP types other than 8, and the count of ICMP type 8 packets is zero.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," and type 1 corresponds to "Host Unreachable" or "Network Unreachable," which are normal ICMP error messages rather than flooding.

No heuristic or taxonomy references apply here due to lack of data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Investigate if these ICMP error messages correlate with network issues or misconfigurations.
- Collect more detailed logs or anomaly data to detect other potential threats.
