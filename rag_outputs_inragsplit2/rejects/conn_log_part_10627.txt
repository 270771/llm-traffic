Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. There are no known anomalous source or destination IPs linked to heuristic 20 or any other heuristic, and no anomaly records were found.

No other attack patterns are evident from the data. Without multiple repeated ICMP echo requests or additional anomaly context, this traffic appears to be a normal single ping request.

No heuristic or taxonomy applies here due to lack of anomalies. Further investigation is not warranted based on this single log entry alone. Monitoring for increased ICMP echo request volume or additional suspicious IPs is recommended.
