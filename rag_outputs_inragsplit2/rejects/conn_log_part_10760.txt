Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the 11th column (ICMP type/code). The first entry shows ICMP type 0, and the second entry shows ICMP type 84, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request).  
- There are only two ICMP entries total, both with types other than 8, and the count of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, which is below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets and increase logging granularity if possible.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or other protocols that may indicate different attack vectors.
