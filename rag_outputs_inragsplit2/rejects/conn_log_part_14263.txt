Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for ping floods.
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 instances; in fact, none are present.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.
- The traffic does not match known ping flood patterns, which require multiple ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source to the same destination.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps:
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes.
- Investigate if ICMP type 11 messages are symptomatic of other network issues such as routing loops or TTL expiry.
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context for comprehensive analysis.
