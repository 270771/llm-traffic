Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic volume and frequency do not match typical ping flood patterns, which involve rapid, repeated ICMP echo requests from one or more sources to overwhelm a target.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP echo request volume from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these IPs have prior suspicious activity in other logs.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out emerging ping flood or other ICMP-based attacks.
