Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 8, which is the echo request type used in ping.  
- However, there are only 3 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the instance count rule.  
- The traffic pattern does not show a high volume or rapid repetition from the same source to the same destination that would indicate flooding.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no alternative classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if the volume threshold is eventually met.  
- Investigate the involved IPs (133.247.86.159, 157.17.50.17, 133.247.170.126) for any other suspicious activity or alerts in other logs.
