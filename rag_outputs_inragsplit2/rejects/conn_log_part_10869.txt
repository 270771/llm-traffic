Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 61.1.51.193 to destination 129.124.159.200, and there is only 1 instance of this type.
- The other ICMP entries are type 1 and 0, which are not Echo Requests and thus not relevant to ping floods.
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is not met here.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 1 and 0 packets could be normal network behavior (e.g., Destination Unreachable or Echo Reply), not an attack.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.
- Investigate if the source IP 61.1.51.193 is known for suspicious activity in other logs.
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out potential ICMP-based attacks.
