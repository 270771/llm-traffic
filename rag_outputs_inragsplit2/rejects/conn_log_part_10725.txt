Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) is present in the snippet (timestamp 1641099638.012962), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood. Other ICMP entries have types 0, 1, or 11, which do not correspond to echo requests and thus are not part of a ping flood pattern.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types. Given the lack of multiple ICMP type 8 packets and no known anomalous IPs, no ping flood or related ICMP-based attack is detected.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs. If the count rises above 10 within a short time frame, re-evaluate for ping flood activity. Also, investigate the source IP 133.247.237.137 sending the single ICMP echo request to 200.96.113.56 for any unusual behavior in broader logs.
