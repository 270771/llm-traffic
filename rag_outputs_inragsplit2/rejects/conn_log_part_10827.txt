Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type field is not explicitly shown, but the conn.log entries indicate ICMP traffic with no evidence of type 8 (Echo Request) packets.
- The first entry shows ICMP traffic from 202.194.36.224 to 170.222.151.95 with 1 packet of 56 bytes, which is insufficient to meet the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets for a ping flood.
- The second entry is IPv6 ICMP traffic with zero packets sent.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches.
- The traffic pattern does not match a ping flood, which requires multiple ICMP Echo Requests flooding a target.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased ICMP Echo Request counts from these or other IPs.
- Collect more detailed ICMP type information in logs to confirm packet types.
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or anomalies in related logs.
