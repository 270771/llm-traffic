Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, it does not match the ping flood criteria. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood, and no anomalies or heuristics are indicated.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single ICMP Time Exceeded message. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification is possible.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if repeated ICMP type 11 messages correlate with routing or network issues.
