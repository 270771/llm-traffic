Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 11, and 3, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are no repeated instances of ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomaly records or heuristics indicating suspicious IPs or behavior.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic and no anomaly data, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
