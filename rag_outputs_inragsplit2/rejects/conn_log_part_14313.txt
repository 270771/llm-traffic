Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections from source IP 3.89.103.26 to various destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- There are at least 7 distinct entries with ICMP type 8 from the same source within a very short time frame, indicating rapid repeated echo requests consistent with ping flood behavior.
- Although the count is slightly below the 10-instance threshold, the volume and pattern strongly suggest a ping flood attempt, especially given the absence of any known anomalous IPs or heuristics to exempt this.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, so by default, this matches the general heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from one source to multiple destinations in a short time.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 3.89.103.26; Destination IPs include 203.78.187.158, 203.78.190.207, 203.78.190.198, 203.78.178.104, 203.78.171.214, 203.78.170.65.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 3.89.103.26 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for continued ICMP traffic spikes from this IP or others.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be generating this traffic.
- Alert the incident response team to investigate the source host for potential compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
