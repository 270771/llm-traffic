Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log entry shows ICMP traffic from 202.124.53.30 to 89.3.89.164 with ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping floods require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.  
- Only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- The anomaly record (anomaly_782) relates to a SYN attack (heuristic 10) from source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, unrelated to ICMP or ping floods. Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which involve TCP SYN packets, not ICMP.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly further by analyzing TCP connection attempts from 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 to identify potential SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect possible future ping flood attempts.
