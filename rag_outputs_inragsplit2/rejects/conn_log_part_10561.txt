Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 0, 11, and 3, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8 in the snippet, and no anomaly records or heuristic context to suggest otherwise.
- Without ICMP type 8 traffic and at least 10 such instances, the traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes.
- Collect more extended logs to verify if any ICMP Echo Requests increase in frequency.
- Investigate any future anomalies related to ICMP type 8 or known suspicious IPs.
