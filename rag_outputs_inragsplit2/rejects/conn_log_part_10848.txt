Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the required type for ping floods.
- Multiple source IPs (e.g., 130.197.61.124, 130.197.61.72, 130.197.21.30, etc.) are sending ICMP Echo Requests to a single destination IP 69.47.68.29, indicating a distributed pattern consistent with a ping flood.
- The absence of anomaly CSV records and heuristic context means we assign a default heuristic number 20 (commonly used for ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: multiple sources from the 130.197.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 61.1.51.193, 157.17.49.222) targeting 69.47.68.29 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with network performance degradation.
- Engage upstream ISP to filter or block malicious traffic if attack volume is large.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts within the source IP ranges to remediate potential botnet involvement.
- Alert incident response team to prepare for potential escalation or collateral attacks.
