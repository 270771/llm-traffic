Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 (echo request) traffic, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to consider a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP types present are not type 8, so they do not contribute to ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without further evidence or heuristic context, no immediate security incident is detected.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify if a pattern of repeated ICMP echo requests emerges.  
- Investigate the behavior of IPs 131.176.31.70 and 131.176.31.76 sending ICMP type 8 packets to 13.66.251.210 for any unusual activity.
