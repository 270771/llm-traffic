Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP traffic entries with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.  
- All entries are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP type 8 packets are present.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any IPs or ports related to ICMP or ping flood heuristics (heuristic 20).  
- The heuristics present (10 and 999) correspond to SYN attacks and other unspecified anomalies, not ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks (TCP SYN flood), not ping floods.  
- Heuristic 999 is uncategorized or unknown anomaly.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) involving source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 for potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 in future logs to detect possible ping floods.  
- Verify if any hosts are experiencing high ICMP traffic outside this snippet.
