Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The two ICMP entries have types 3 and 13, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 is a Destination Unreachable message, and type 13 is Timestamp Request, both normal control messages rather than attack traffic.

Next steps:
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume.
- Investigate if any new anomaly records or heuristics become available that might indicate other attack types.
- Continue logging and analyzing ICMP traffic patterns for potential future threats.
