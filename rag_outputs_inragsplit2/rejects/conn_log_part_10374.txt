Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 52.181.47.160, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send numerous ICMP echo requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs from the 133.228.x.x and 69.47.68.36 ranges, all targeting destination IP 52.181.47.160 on ICMP type 8.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.181.47.160.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the identified source IPs exhibiting suspicious ICMP flood behavior.
  4. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP flood attempts and prepare for possible escalation to volumetric DoS mitigation services.
