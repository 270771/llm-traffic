Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP type values in the snippet are either 3 or 11, none are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- ICMP types 3 and 11 correspond to Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded messages, which are not indicative of ping floods but may relate to network errors or traceroute-like activity.

Since no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. However, the presence of multiple ICMP type 3 and 11 messages could warrant further investigation into network reachability or routing issues.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 and 11 messages for potential misconfigurations or scanning activity.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to better classify future anomalies.
