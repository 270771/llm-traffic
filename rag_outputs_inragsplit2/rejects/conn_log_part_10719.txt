Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is indicated by the 11th column (ICMP type/code). The first entry shows a value of 140, and the second entry shows a dash (-), neither of which corresponds to ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- Additionally, there are only two ICMP connection entries total, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to consider a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other types of attacks.

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy context is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.
- Collect more comprehensive logs including ICMP type and code fields explicitly.
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same IPs.
