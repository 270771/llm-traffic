Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (ICMP code 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded, not type 8 Echo Request), so it does not match the required ICMP type 8 for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of this ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest other attack types. The ICMP type 11 traffic could be related to legitimate network diagnostics or routing issues, not an attack.

No further immediate action is required for ping flood detection. However, monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic or repeated ICMP errors could be prudent to detect future anomalies.
