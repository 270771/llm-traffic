Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) originating from the same source IP 163.171.168.73 to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame. There are at least 10 such instances, satisfying the threshold for a ping flood.
- This pattern matches known ping flood behavior: rapid, repeated ICMP Echo Requests aimed at overwhelming targets.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the most likely heuristic number is 20 (as referenced in the instructions for known anomalous IPs), and the taxonomy class is "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.171.168.73; Destination IPs include 163.252.63.249, 163.252.93.39, 163.252.14.249, 163.252.9.211, 163.252.12.17, 163.252.47.198, 163.252.3.233, 163.252.0.62.
- Ports are ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), port fields are zero or not applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Implement or tune existing DDoS mitigation controls to handle ICMP flood traffic.
