Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is evident from this single ICMP unreachable message. Further investigation could include monitoring for repeated ICMP type 8 packets or other suspicious traffic patterns to detect potential reconnaissance or denial-of-service attempts.
