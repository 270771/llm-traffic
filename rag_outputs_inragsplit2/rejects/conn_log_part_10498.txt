Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field relevant for ping flood detection is type 8 (Echo Request).  
- The snippet shows only 2 instances where ICMP type 8 is present from the same source IP (54.183.69.91) to different destinations (163.252.70.200 and 163.252.71.82). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types other than 8 or insufficient repetition to indicate flooding.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the data. The OTH (other) connection state and lack of repeated ICMP Echo Requests suggest normal or unrelated ICMP traffic.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or anomalies in related logs.  
- If anomaly data or heuristic context becomes available, re-evaluate with that information.
