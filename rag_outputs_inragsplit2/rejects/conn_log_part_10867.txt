Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows no ICMP type 8 (echo request) specified, and only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or patterns.

No other attack type is evident from the given data. Without ICMP type 8 or multiple repeated requests, this traffic does not match ping flood characteristics.

Next steps: Investigate further by collecting more comprehensive ICMP traffic logs, ensuring ICMP type fields are captured, and monitoring for repeated echo requests from the same source IP. Also, enable anomaly detection to identify suspicious IPs or ports that could trigger heuristic 20 or other relevant heuristics.
