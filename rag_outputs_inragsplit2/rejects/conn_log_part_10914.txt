Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 0 (echo reply) from 58.193.7.116 to 133.251.199.227, not type 8 (echo request). Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is indicated by this data. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic appears benign.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets or any new anomaly records involving these IPs to reassess potential ping flood activity.
