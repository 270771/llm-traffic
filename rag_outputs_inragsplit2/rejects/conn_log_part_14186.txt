Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is **not** happening.

Reasoning:  
- All Zeek conn.log entries are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present in the snippet.  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods, but no ICMP records or type 8 packets are shown.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference heuristic 20 (Ping flood); instead, they show heuristic 10 (SYN attack) and heuristic 999 (other), neither related to ICMP or ping floods.  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which matches the TCP SYN flag-heavy traffic seen in the logs (many S0 states indicating SYN sent but no response).  
- The taxonomy classes 'ptmp' and 'mptmp' relate to partial or multiple partial TCP connections, consistent with SYN flood or scanning behavior, not ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 flagged under heuristic 10 for potential SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect possible ping floods in the future.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for SYN flood signatures.

No ping flood attack is present; the current anomalies align with heuristic 10 (SYN attack) and taxonomy class 'ptmp' (partial TCP connections).
