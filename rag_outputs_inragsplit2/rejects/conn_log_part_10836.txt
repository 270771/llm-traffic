Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 13 (timestamp request), not type 8 (echo request). Ping flood attacks require multiple (at least 10) ICMP type 8 packets. Here, only one ICMP packet of type 13 is present, which does not match ping flood criteria.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types. The ICMP type 13 is typically benign or used for network diagnostics, not flooding.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP. If such patterns emerge, investigate for potential ping flood attacks. Also, consider enabling logging or anomaly detection for ICMP echo requests to capture future suspicious activity.
