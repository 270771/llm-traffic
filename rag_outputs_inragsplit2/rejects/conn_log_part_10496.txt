Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (destination unreachable), not type 8 (echo request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 echo requests needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

This traffic does not match ping flood patterns but could indicate network issues or misconfigurations causing unreachable destinations. Without heuristic context or anomaly data, no further attack classification is possible.

Next steps: Investigate the cause of ICMP type 3 messages to ensure network stability and verify no underlying connectivity problems. Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests that might indicate emerging ping flood activity.
