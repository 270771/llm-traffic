Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears 5 times from source IP 3.80.126.221 to various destination IPs, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types different from 8, which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The presence of a few ICMP echo requests is normal network behavior and does not meet the volume or pattern criteria for flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or frequency.  
- Investigate if the source IP 3.80.126.221 is known for suspicious activity in other logs or anomaly feeds.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
