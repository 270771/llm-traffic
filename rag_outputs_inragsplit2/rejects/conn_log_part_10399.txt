Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV or the logs. The only anomaly present is heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to a different IP and port, unrelated to ICMP traffic.  
- The anomaly taxonomy "ptmp" with heuristic 10 indicates a SYN flood or SYN-based attack, not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 further for potential SYN flood activity as indicated by heuristic 10.  
- Enable or collect ICMP-specific logs to monitor for any future ICMP Echo Request floods.  
- Confirm if any firewall or IDS rules are triggered for ICMP traffic to detect ping floods proactively.
