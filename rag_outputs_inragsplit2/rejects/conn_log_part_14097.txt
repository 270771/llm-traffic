Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 54.193.126.151 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests are sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.

Since no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the most likely heuristic is heuristic 20 (as referenced in the instructions for known anomalous IPs), which relates to detecting ping floods by counting ICMP type 8 packets. The taxonomy class is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Involved IPs:
- Destination: 54.193.126.151 (target of the ping flood)
- Sources: Multiple IPs in the 133.247.x.x range (e.g., 133.247.104.202, 133.247.139.249, 133.247.180.6, etc.)

Ports: ICMP does not use ports, so none are applicable.

Recommended Security Response:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 traffic targeting 54.193.126.151.
- Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
- Monitor the target host for resource exhaustion or service degradation.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on the target if not required for legitimate operations.
