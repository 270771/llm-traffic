Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log snippet are 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 3 again, not 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 packets, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, both type 3, which are error messages rather than echo requests.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other suspicious activity.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are additional logs with ICMP type 8 packets or higher volume from the same IPs to confirm if a ping flood or other ICMP-based attack is occurring.  
- Monitor for repeated ICMP type 3 messages, which could indicate network issues or misconfigurations worth investigating.
