Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IPs, notably 3.127.149.71 and 18.11.193.42, indicating repeated ping requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The source IPs are diverse (e.g., 130.197.163.33, 133.247.38.79, 130.197.144.160, 133.247.79.50), suggesting a distributed or coordinated flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (known for ping flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the involved IPs are:
  - Sources: 130.197.163.33, 133.247.38.79, 130.197.144.160, 133.247.79.50, 133.247.93.2, 130.197.19.12, 133.247.84.1, 133.247.178.223, 133.228.217.183, 133.247.162.193, 133.247.25.249, 133.247.82.249, 130.197.21.129
  - Destinations: 3.127.149.71, 18.11.193.42, 43.202.248.60

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the affected destination IPs (3.127.149.71 and 18.11.193.42) at the network perimeter firewall.
- Block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from suspicious source IPs identified in the logs.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs to detect possible amplification or reflection attacks.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule specifically targeting ICMP flood patterns to automate mitigation.
