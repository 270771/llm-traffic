Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries show ICMP types 3 and 11, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) are typically normal network control messages, not indicative of flooding or DoS.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume.  
- Investigate if these ICMP type 3 and 11 messages correlate with network issues or misconfigurations.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
