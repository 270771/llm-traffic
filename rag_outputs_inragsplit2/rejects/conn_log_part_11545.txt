Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (destination unreachable) for both source and destination ports, and the ICMP type field is not 8 (echo request). Only one instance is present, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single connection log entry. Without multiple ICMP echo requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic does not match ping flood heuristics.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the destination IP. If multiple echo requests accumulate, re-evaluate for potential ping flood activity.
