Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from 133.247.49.34 to 23.21.228.166, and there is only one instance of this type in the snippet.
- The other ICMP entries have types 3 and 1, which are not Echo Requests and thus not part of a ping flood.
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, so the threshold for a ping flood is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 1 (Host Unreachable) messages may indicate normal network error reporting rather than an attack.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Investigate if the IP 133.247.49.34 repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame.
- Collect more extended logs to detect any emerging patterns consistent with ping floods or other ICMP-based attacks.
