Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests (echo request) must be 8. In the snippet, only 3 entries have ICMP type 8 (lines with src IPs 3.78.5.55 and 35.100.170.152).  
- The total count of ICMP type 8 packets is fewer than 10, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  
- Other ICMP types (e.g., type 3, type 0) are present but do not indicate ping flood activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (destination unreachable) and type 0 (echo reply) is normal in network traffic.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate if any of the involved IPs (3.78.5.55, 35.100.170.152, 203.78.173.222, 203.78.173.230) show other suspicious behavior in broader logs.  
- Collect anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
