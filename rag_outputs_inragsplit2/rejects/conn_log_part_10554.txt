Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference heuristic 20 (Ping flood) or any ICMP-related anomalies; they reference heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (heavy hitter), both unrelated to ICMP ping floods.  
- The heuristics context confirms heuristic 20 corresponds specifically to ping floods, which is not triggered here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) further, as it indicates potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Review network traffic for ICMP packets separately to confirm no hidden ping flood activity.  
- Monitor source IPs 133.251.127.196 and 185.58.127.74 for suspicious TCP behavior as indicated by anomalies.

No ping flood is detected; the current anomalies relate to TCP SYN-based suspicious activity (heuristic 10: SYN attack).
