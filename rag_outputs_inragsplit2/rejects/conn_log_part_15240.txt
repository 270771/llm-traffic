Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 ICMP connections from a single source IP (15.130.145.131) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 15.130.145.131 is flooding multiple destination IPs (202.194.13.98, 202.194.13.54, 202.194.13.96, 202.194.63.2, 202.194.63.8, 202.194.15.190, 202.194.36.234, 202.194.48.54, 202.194.48.62). Ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 15.130.145.131 at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs.
  3. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or enabling ICMP rate limiting on routers.
  5. Review and update intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) signatures to detect similar patterns.
