Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets originating from a single source IP (161.67.42.226) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame. Specifically, there are at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets from 161.67.42.226 to various 133.251.x.x addresses, matching the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (as per your instructions) related to ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession from one source to multiple destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 161.67.42.226; Destination IPs include 133.251.203.40, 133.251.201.193, 133.251.200.62, 133.251.203.66, 133.251.200.65, 133.251.201.192, 133.251.200.33.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type and code fields confirm echo requests (type 8, code 0).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 161.67.42.226 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP and related addresses.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be participating in or affected by the flood.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate the source host for potential compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools or enabling existing DDoS protection services.
