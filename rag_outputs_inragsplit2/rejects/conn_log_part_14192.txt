Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is 11, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type 8 (Echo Request) required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP record present, far below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types. The current traffic does not match known ping flood patterns or other ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps: Investigate further ICMP traffic for repeated Echo Requests (type 8) from the same source IP to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts. Monitor for any increase in ICMP traffic volume or anomalies in source/destination IP behavior.
