Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV records; the anomalies present relate to heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (other suspicious activity), neither of which indicate ICMP or ping flood activity.  
- The anomaly taxonomy classes 'ptmp' and 'mptmp' correspond to port-based TCP anomalies, not ICMP floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 flagged under heuristic 10 (SYN attack) for potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.  
- Verify if ICMP traffic is being logged correctly by Zeek to ensure visibility.

No evidence supports a ping flood attack at this time.
