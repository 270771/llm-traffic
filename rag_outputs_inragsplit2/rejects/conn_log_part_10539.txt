Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is logged here.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly record (anomaly_782) relates to a SYN attack (heuristic 10) on TCP port 8080, not ICMP traffic.  
- Heuristic 20, which corresponds to ping flood, is not triggered or referenced in the anomaly CSV.  

The anomaly detected (heuristic 10) indicates a SYN attack pattern, characterized by many SYN packets on port 8080 from source IP 89.3.89.164, consistent with a TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 for potential SYN flood or port scanning activity on port 8080.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect possible ping floods in the future.  
- Review firewall and IDS rules to ensure SYN flood protections are active and tuned for port 8080.
