Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV does not reference any heuristic 20 (Ping flood) anomalies; the only heuristics mentioned are 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (other).  
- The heuristic 20 specifically relates to ping flood detection, which requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs flagged under heuristic 20, neither of which are present.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the current data. The anomalies detected relate to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and an unspecified anomaly (heuristic 999), which are unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) on source IP 89.3.89.164 port 8080 for potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Enable or review ICMP logging to capture ICMP traffic explicitly for future detection of ping floods.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to confirm absence of ICMP flood activity.
