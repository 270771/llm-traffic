Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (lines with src IPs 157.17.49.222 and 133.247.173.176). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack. The other ICMP entries are type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which do not indicate ping floods.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise. Without at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20, this traffic does not meet the criteria for a ping flood.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs. Investigate if any of these IPs appear in other logs or alerts. If ICMP Echo Requests spike above the threshold, reassess for ping flood activity.
