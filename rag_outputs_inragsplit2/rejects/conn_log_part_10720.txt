Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are 11, 11, and 8. Only one instance of ICMP type 8 is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP types (11) correspond to Time Exceeded messages, not echo requests (type 8), so they do not indicate ping flood activity.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 11 messages may warrant investigation into possible network routing or TTL issues but does not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the cause of ICMP type 11 messages if persistent, as they may indicate network path issues.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
