Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The ICMP type in the log is 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance recorded, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single ICMP Time Exceeded message. Further investigation could include monitoring for repeated ICMP type 11 messages or other ICMP types that might indicate network scanning or misconfiguration, but no immediate threat is evident here.
