Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference ICMP or heuristic 20 (ping flood); they mostly relate to TCP-based anomalies such as SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitters (heuristic 999).  
- Heuristic 20 explicitly corresponds to ping flood attacks, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets, absent here.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the TCP SYN anomalies further, especially those flagged under heuristic 10 (SYN attack) and heuristic 999 (heavy hitter), as these may indicate scanning or DoS attempts.  
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs separately to detect any potential ping floods not captured in this snippet.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from suspicious IPs to promptly detect ping flood attempts.
