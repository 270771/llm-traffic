Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows multiple UDP and TCP connections but no ICMP traffic entries.
- ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is required to identify ping floods, and none are present in the provided logs.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference heuristic 20 (Ping flood) or any ICMP-related anomalies; they mostly indicate SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitters (heuristic 999).
- The heuristics confirm that ping flood anomalies would be flagged under heuristic 20, which is absent here.

No other attack type matching ping flood is evident. The anomalies detected relate to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitter behavior (heuristic 999), which correspond to TCP SYN floods or scanning activity, not ICMP floods.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies (heuristic 10) further by reviewing connection attempts from source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 and source IP 185.58.127.74 on port 1433.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Confirm if any network devices are dropping or logging ICMP traffic separately, as absence here may be due to logging configuration.
