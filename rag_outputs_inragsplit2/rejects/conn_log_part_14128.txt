Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood); they only mention heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (heavy hitter).
- Heuristic 20 specifically relates to ping flood detection, which requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets; none are found here.

The anomalies detected correspond to:
- Heuristic 10: SYN attack (TCP SYN flood or similar)
- Heuristic 999: Heavy hitter (high volume suspicious traffic on port 1433)

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack indicated by heuristic 10, as multiple TCP SYN packets with no completion (S0 state) are present, which may indicate a SYN flood.
- Monitor the source IPs involved in these TCP SYN anomalies for potential scanning or DoS activity.
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs separately to confirm or rule out ping flood attacks in the future.

No ping flood is detected; focus should be on TCP SYN anomalies per heuristic 10 (SYN attack) taxonomy.
