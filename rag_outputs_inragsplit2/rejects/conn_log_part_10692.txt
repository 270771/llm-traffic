Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference heuristic 20 (Ping flood); instead, they show heuristic 10 (SYN attack) and heuristic 999 (Other).  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which aligns with the many TCP SYN (S0) flags seen in the conn.log, indicating possible SYN scanning or SYN flood attempts, but not ICMP ping floods.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high number of TCP SYN (S0) flagged connections, especially from source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 (anomaly_782), as this matches heuristic 10 (SYN attack).  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect potential ping floods in the future.  
- Verify if the SYN activity is causing service degradation or denial of service.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 indicates SYN attacks, characterized by many SYN packets without completing TCP handshakes.  
- Taxonomy 'ptmp' refers to partial TCP message patterns typical in SYN scans or floods.

No ping flood is detected; focus should be on investigating SYN anomalies further.
