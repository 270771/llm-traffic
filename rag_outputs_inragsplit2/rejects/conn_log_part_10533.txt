Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 1 and 10, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, both with different types and no repetition of type 8.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Since heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
