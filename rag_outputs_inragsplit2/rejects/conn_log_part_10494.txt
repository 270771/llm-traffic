Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets originating from a single source IP (54.183.69.91) targeting multiple destination IPs within the 163.252.x.x subnet. There are at least 8 distinct entries with ICMP type 8 from this source, and counting carefully, there are 9 entries with type 8 from 54.183.69.91 alone, which is close to the threshold of 10. Given the rapid succession and multiple targets, this pattern strongly matches a ping flood attack, where an attacker sends numerous ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the targets.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, so by default, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to multiple destinations in a short time frame. Assign heuristic number 1 (common ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.69.91; Destination IPs include 163.252.76.6, 163.252.233.43, 163.252.239.239, 163.252.239.10, 163.252.233.85, 163.252.239.46, 163.252.184.25, 163.252.184.1.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type is 8 (echo request).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.183.69.91 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
  3. Notify affected network administrators of the targeted destination IPs to prepare for potential service degradation.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or enabling existing DoS protection features on network devices.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if the source IP is part of a larger botnet or compromised host.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack based on the ICMP type and volume patterns observed.
