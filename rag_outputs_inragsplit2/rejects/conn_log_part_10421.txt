Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 54.178.233.150, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, but by default, heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" apply here given the volume and uniform ICMP type.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.178.233.150 on ICMP protocol (no ports).
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 54.178.233.150. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP ranges. Monitor for collateral impact and consider blackholing traffic if attack persists. Notify network operations and prepare for potential escalation to upstream providers for mitigation support.
