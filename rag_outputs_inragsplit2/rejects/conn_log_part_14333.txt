Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with no ICMP type 8 specified, and only one packet is logged. Since the ICMP type is not explicitly 8 (echo request), and there are fewer than 10 such instances, this does not meet the criteria for a ping flood attack. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single connection log entry. Without further data or anomalies, no immediate threat is evident.

Next steps: Collect more comprehensive ICMP traffic logs to verify if multiple ICMP type 8 packets occur from the same source to the same destination. Investigate if any heuristic 20-related IPs appear in future logs to reassess potential ping flood activity.
