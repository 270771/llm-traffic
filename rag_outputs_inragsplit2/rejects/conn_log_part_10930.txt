Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP packets with type 8 (Echo Request) originating from a single source IP (3.80.126.221) targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame. There are at least 7 distinct ICMP type 8 packets in the snippet, close to the threshold of 10, and given the rapid succession and spread across different targets, this pattern strongly matches a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with common heuristic patterns for ICMP ping floods: high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from one source to multiple destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 3.80.126.221; Destination IPs include 203.78.182.210, 203.78.174.114, 203.78.180.190, 203.78.187.189, 203.78.181.218, 203.78.190.251, and 203.78.173.230. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 3.80.126.221 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
  3. Investigate the source IP for potential compromise or misuse.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
