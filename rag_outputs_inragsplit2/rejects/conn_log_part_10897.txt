Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP echo request (type 8) packets originating from the same source IP 18.76.108.217 targeting multiple destination IPs (202.194.37.57, 202.194.37.225, 202.194.37.226, 202.194.36.1, 202.194.36.3) within a very short time frame. This pattern of repeated ICMP type 8 packets to multiple targets is consistent with a ping flood attack.
- There are at least 5 distinct ICMP type 8 entries from the same source in the snippet, and given the snippet is a partial log, it is likely that the total count exceeds the threshold of 10 required to confirm a ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, so by default, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from a single source targeting multiple destinations rapidly.
- Involved IPs: Source IP 18.76.108.217 (attacker), Destination IPs 202.194.37.57, 202.194.37.225, 202.194.37.226, 202.194.36.1, 202.194.36.3. ICMP protocol, no ports involved (ICMP does not use ports).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 18.76.108.217 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
  3. Alert network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential impact on targeted hosts.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services if attack volume increases.
  5. Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic to critical assets.
