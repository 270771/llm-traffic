Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 3. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods. Here, there is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (from 128.253.31.180 to 133.102.115.185).  
- The other entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.  
- The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, which is not met here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate if the source IP 128.253.31.180 or destination 133.102.115.185 appear in future logs with higher ICMP Echo Request counts.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging threats.
