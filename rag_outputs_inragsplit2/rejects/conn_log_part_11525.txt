Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log are 3 and 0, not 8. ICMP type 8 is required for echo request packets used in ping floods.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets, and none are present here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," and type 0 is "Echo Reply," which are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made. However, it is recommended to continue monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes and investigate if future logs show repeated echo requests from a single source to a destination, which could indicate a ping flood.
