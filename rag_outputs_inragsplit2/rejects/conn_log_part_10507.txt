Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the snippet are 11 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 in the log, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).  
- The ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) is unrelated to ping floods and does not indicate this attack type.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without further anomalies or heuristic matches, no immediate threat is detected.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if any of the involved IPs (203.78.179.25, 118.62.217.228, 138.207.89.44, 163.252.127.193) appear in future anomaly records or show suspicious behavior.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect patterns that may emerge over time.
