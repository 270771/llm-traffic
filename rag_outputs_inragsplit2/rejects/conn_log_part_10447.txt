Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies, which is not indicated here. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is evident from this single connection log entry. The ICMP type 11 typically relates to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed based on this data. However, monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic or multiple repeated ICMP connections from the same source IP (212.124.130.1) could be a prudent next step.
