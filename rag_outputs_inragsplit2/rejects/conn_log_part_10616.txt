Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 11 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 3.80.126.221 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets indicates an attempt to overwhelm the network or hosts with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with common heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 3.80.126.221; Destination IPs include 133.251.114.228, 133.251.127.220, 133.251.114.96, 133.251.127.245, 133.251.126.16, 133.251.115.0, 133.251.113.41, 133.251.115.217, 133.251.112.237, 133.251.112.101.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 3.80.126.221 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network devices for signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security appliances.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
