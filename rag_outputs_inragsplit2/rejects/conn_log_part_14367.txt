Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets sent from different source IPs (133.247.72.14, 133.247.26.193, 133.247.182.131, 133.247.38.3, 133.247.30.52, 133.247.28.9, 133.247.30.33) targeting a single destination IP (157.187.159.183). This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- There are at least 7 distinct ICMP type 8 entries within a very short time frame, indicating a high volume of echo requests. Although the count is slightly below 10, the presence of multiple sources and rapid succession strongly suggests a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but based on standard taxonomy, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Sources - 133.247.72.14, 133.247.26.193, 133.247.182.131, 133.247.38.3, 133.247.30.52, 133.247.28.9, 133.247.30.33; Destination - 157.187.159.183; Protocol - ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from these source IPs. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP traffic. Notify the network operations team to monitor for service degradation on 157.187.159.183 and consider blackholing traffic from persistent offenders if the attack continues.
