Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 34.55.10.218, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources to a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 34.55.10.218 on ICMP protocol (no ports for ICMP).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
  3. Monitor the target host 34.55.10.218 for service degradation and consider isolating it if the attack persists.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter attack traffic closer to the source.
  5. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these sources are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
