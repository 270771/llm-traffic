Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 34.55.10.218 from multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x subnet. This pattern of many ICMP type 8 packets from multiple sources to one destination matches the classic distributed ICMP ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.59.72, 133.247.94.118, 133.247.25.249, etc.) targeting destination IP 34.55.10.218 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping flood traffic.
- Assign heuristic number 20 (common heuristic for ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood" as the most likely labels.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16) at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor the victim IP 34.55.10.218 for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Notify network operations to investigate potential compromised hosts in the source IP range.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from persistent offenders if attack volume escalates.
