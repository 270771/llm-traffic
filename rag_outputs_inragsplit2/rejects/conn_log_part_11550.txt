Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 195.237.218.4 to destination 203.78.177.156, with a single instance logged (count=1). This is well below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack pattern is evident from the given data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same or other sources.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP type 8 packets exceeding the threshold.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems if available.
