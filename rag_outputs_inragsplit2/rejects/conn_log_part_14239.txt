Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is `3` for both entries, which corresponds to "Destination Unreachable," not type `8` (Echo Request) required for ping floods.  
- There are only two ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood, unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not present here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP type 3 messages could be normal network error responses.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume.  
- Investigate if any hosts are generating excessive ICMP error messages, which might indicate misconfiguration or other issues.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
