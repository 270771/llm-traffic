Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20, neither of which are present.  
- The anomaly CSV record references a suspicious connection unrelated to ICMP or ping floods (heuristic 999, taxonomy 'mptmp'), which does not apply here.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the provided data. The connections mostly show failed TCP and UDP handshakes (S0, S0 flags), which may indicate scanning or failed connection attempts but not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the repeated failed TCP/UDP connection attempts for potential scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to detect any future ICMP-based anomalies.  
- Review heuristic 999 and anomaly 'mptmp' for possible relevance to other attack types.
