Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV or visible in the logs.  
- The anomaly record present (heuristic 10) relates to a SYN attack, which involves TCP SYN packets, not ICMP.  

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP SYN traffic.  
- The anomaly taxonomy class 'ptmp' is linked to port and TCP flag anomalies, consistent with SYN flood behavior.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 flagged under heuristic 10 for potential SYN flood or TCP-based DoS activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect possible ping floods in the future.  
- Review firewall and IDS logs for ICMP anomalies to ensure no ping flood attempts are missed.
