Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets originating from a single source IP 52.158.11.176 targeting multiple destination IPs within the 163.252.x.x range. This pattern of multiple rapid ICMP Echo Requests to various targets is consistent with a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit heuristics or anomaly taxonomy records are provided, the behavior matches a classic ICMP ping flood heuristic: high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from one source to multiple destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.158.11.176; Destination IPs include 163.252.195.152, 163.252.27.83, 163.252.78.249, 163.252.195.75, 163.252.78.237, 163.252.205.57, 163.252.232.246.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8, confirming Echo Requests.
- Security response plan:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 52.158.11.176 at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP or related IPs.
  3. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be participating in or affected by the flood.
  4. Alert the incident response team to investigate potential upstream sources or botnet involvement.
  5. Implement ICMP traffic anomaly detection rules to prevent recurrence.
