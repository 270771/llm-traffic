Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present but only in a few isolated instances (4 entries with type 8: from IPs 130.197.190.249, 130.197.190.209, 130.197.190.247, and one from 203.78.177.156).  
- The total count of ICMP type 8 packets is less than 10, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP types (3 and others) are present but are unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) packets suggests normal network error reporting rather than an attack.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be assigned. However, the low volume and distribution of ICMP echo requests do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring ICMP traffic for any increase in ICMP type 8 packet frequency.  
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets if their behavior changes or volume spikes.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems if available to detect emerging threats.
