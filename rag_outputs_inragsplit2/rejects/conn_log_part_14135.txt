Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 9 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 16.172.102.121 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the type used in ping floods.
- Although the count is just under 10, the volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different destinations strongly indicate a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic practice, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP: Source 16.172.102.121 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 133.251.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 16.172.102.121 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with network performance degradation.
- Investigate the source host 16.172.102.121 for compromise or misuse.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to prevent recurrence.
