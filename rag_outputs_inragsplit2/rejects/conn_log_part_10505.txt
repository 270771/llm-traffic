Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8. The snippet shows only two entries with ICMP type 8 from source IP 54.183.69.91 to two different destinations, which is fewer than the required minimum of 10 instances to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types different from 8, which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume over a longer period or checking for other anomaly sources.
