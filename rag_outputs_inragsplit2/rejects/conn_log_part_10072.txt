Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (34.55.10.218) from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple sources in the 133.247.x.x range sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination 34.55.10.218. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16).
  2. Monitor the target host (34.55.10.218) for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Engage upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering or blocking malicious traffic upstream.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
  5. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
