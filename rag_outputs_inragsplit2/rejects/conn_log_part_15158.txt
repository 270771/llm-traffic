Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets originating from the IP 54.253.199.134 targeting multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (timestamps nearly identical), matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP: Source IP 54.253.199.134 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 133.251.x.x range. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 54.253.199.134 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this source.
  3. Investigate the source IP for potential compromise or malicious intent.
  4. Alert network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
