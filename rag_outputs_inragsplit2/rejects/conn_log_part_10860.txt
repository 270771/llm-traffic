Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have types 13, 10, and 0, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are no instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, so the minimum threshold of 10 such packets is not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The entries show ICMP traffic but not of the type or volume consistent with a ping flood or other known ICMP-based attacks.

Next steps:
- Investigate further if additional logs show ICMP type 8 packets in high volume.
- Monitor for any anomalies in source or destination IPs that might match heuristic 20 once heuristic context is available.
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data to correlate with traffic patterns.
