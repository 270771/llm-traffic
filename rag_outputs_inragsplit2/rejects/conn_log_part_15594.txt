Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all originating from the IP 35.130.188.37 targeting various destination IPs (203.78.185.198, 203.78.173.218, 203.78.187.173, 203.78.173.230, 203.78.174.112, 203.78.187.158, 203.78.189.166, 203.78.181.209, 203.78.181.217). There are at least 10 such instances, satisfying the threshold for a ping flood.
- ICMP type 8 is the correct type for ping requests, confirming these are echo requests.
- The volume and rapid succession of these echo requests from a single source IP to multiple destinations is consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" as per standard network attack classifications.
- Involved IPs: Source IP 35.130.188.37; Destination IPs include 203.78.185.198, 203.78.173.218, 203.78.187.173, 203.78.173.230, 203.78.174.112, 203.78.187.158, 203.78.189.166, 203.78.181.209, 203.78.181.217.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 35.130.188.37 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any further ICMP traffic spikes from this or related IPs.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts that may be generating this traffic.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs if the source IP is external to coordinate mitigation.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools to catch recurrence early.
