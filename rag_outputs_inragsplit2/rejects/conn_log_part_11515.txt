Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type for ping requests (echo request) is 8. In the provided Zeek conn.log snippet, all ICMP entries have types 3 or 13, except one with type 0 and one with type 13. None have ICMP type 8.
- Since no ICMP type 8 packets are present, the traffic does not match the fundamental requirement for a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.
- ICMP types 3 and 13 correspond to "Destination Unreachable" and "Timestamp" messages, respectively, which are not indicative of ping floods.
- The presence of multiple ICMP type 3 packets could indicate network issues or scanning but not a ping flood.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source IPs sending ICMP type 3 messages (e.g., 202.202.90.45, 133.247.7.60) for potential network misconfigurations or reconnaissance activity.
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 traffic spikes to detect possible ping floods.
- If anomaly data or heuristics become available, correlate with these IPs for further analysis.
