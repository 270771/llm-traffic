Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 8. Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet (second entry), which is below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood unless known anomalous IPs with heuristic 20 are involved.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest these IPs are suspicious or match heuristic 20.  
- The first entry is ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable), which is unrelated to ping floods.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Correlating with other logs or anomaly data to identify suspicious behavior.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be assigned at this time.
