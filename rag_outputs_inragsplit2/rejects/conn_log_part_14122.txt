Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) entries. All entries are TCP or UDP, and the only UDP entries are DNS queries (port 53) with no ICMP type indicated.  
- The heuristic for ping flood (heuristic 20) requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20. Neither condition is met here.  
- The anomalies listed (heuristic 10 and 999) correspond to SYN attacks and other suspicious traffic, not ping floods.  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attack (TCP SYN flood), which is consistent with many TCP connections with SYN flags (S0 state) in the log, indicating possible SYN scanning or SYN flood attempts.  
- Taxonomy classes 'ptmp' and 'mptmp' relate to port-based anomalies and multi-port anomalies, not ICMP flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high number of TCP SYN connection attempts (S0 state) for potential SYN flood or scanning activity, as indicated by heuristic 10.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs to confirm if SYN flood mitigation is needed.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 in future logs to detect possible ping floods.

No ping flood attack is present based on the current data.
