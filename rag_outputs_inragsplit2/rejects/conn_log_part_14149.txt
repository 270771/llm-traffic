Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from `133.247.148.28` to `3.231.100.178`, but there is only 1 instance of this type in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry from `203.78.180.103` to `192.15.210.210` is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are evident from the data. Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to identify potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate the source IP `133.247.148.28` if it repeatedly sends ICMP Echo Requests without legitimate cause.
