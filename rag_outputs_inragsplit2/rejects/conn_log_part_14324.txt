Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (ICMP code 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this log entry. Without heuristic or taxonomy data, no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source or to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP Echo Requests or repeated ICMP traffic patterns.
