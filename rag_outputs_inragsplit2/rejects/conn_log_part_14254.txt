Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded) indicated by the ICMP code 11 in the Zeek log (field 4 = 11), not type 8 (Echo Request). Since the ICMP type is not 8, it does not match the ping flood criteria. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood.

No anomalies or heuristics are present in the anomaly CSV to suggest other attack types. The ICMP type 11 typically relates to traceroute or TTL expiration, not an attack.

No further investigation for ping flood is needed. However, monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) from this or other IPs is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
