Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from source IP 153.156.84.171 to destination 44.61.12.164, but there is only 1 instance of this type in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 1 (Destination Unreachable) from 203.78.180.123 to 64.57.61.171, which is not related to ping flood attacks.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are evident from the data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume or checking for other anomaly sources, but based on the current snippet, no ping flood or related ICMP attack is detected.
