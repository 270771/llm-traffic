Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only four ICMP connection entries, with only two instances of ICMP type 8 (echo request). The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved. Here, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, and no IPs are flagged as suspicious. The other ICMP types (3 and 11) are not related to ping floods.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs. Investigate if any of these IPs later appear in anomaly reports or if traffic volume spikes significantly.
