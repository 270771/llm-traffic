Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records reference heuristics 10 (SYN attack) related to suspicious TCP ports, not heuristic 20 (Ping flood).  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating possible TCP SYN flood or scanning activity, but this is distinct from ICMP ping flooding.  
- No evidence of ICMP traffic or repeated ICMP Echo Requests is present to support a ping flood diagnosis.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the suspicious TCP SYN anomalies (heuristic 10) further, focusing on source IPs 89.3.89.164 and 185.102.240.231, as these may indicate SYN flood or scanning attempts.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to detect any future ICMP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to promptly detect ping floods.

In conclusion, no ping flood attack is detected; the current anomalies align with heuristic 10 (SYN attack) taxonomy, which involves suspicious TCP SYN traffic rather than ICMP flooding.
