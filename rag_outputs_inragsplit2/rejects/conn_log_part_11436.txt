Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from 133.247.49.34 to 189.55.46.249, and there is only 1 such instance, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry from 202.194.58.65 to 167.190.186.87 is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic for ping flood detection requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets, which is not met here.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated ICMP type 8 packets.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect evolving threats.
