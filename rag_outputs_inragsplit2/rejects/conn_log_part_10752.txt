Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 11, which are not type 8 (Echo Request). Since ping flood attacks require ICMP type 8 packets, these entries do not match ping flood criteria.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood, unless heuristic 20 applies (which is not present here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not imply flooding or scanning.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets and volume increases.  
- Investigate if any future logs show repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source to the same destination exceeding threshold counts.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging threats.
