Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

Explanation:  
The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting primarily the IP 34.55.10.218, with multiple different source IPs sending these requests almost simultaneously. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single destination is characteristic of a distributed ICMP ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the target with excessive ping traffic.

Heuristics and Taxonomy:  
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple (â‰¥10) ICMP type 8 packets from various sources targeting a single destination IP.  
- The taxonomy class is "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" under Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

Involved IPs and Ports:  
- Victim IP: 34.55.10.218 (destination)  
- Multiple attacker/source IPs: 133.247.169.81, 133.247.65.220, 133.247.28.185, 133.247.111.174, 133.247.173.109, 133.247.143.224, 133.247.173.177, 133.247.29.150, 133.247.173.117, 133.247.169.154, 133.247.29.235, 133.247.143.255, 133.247.65.158, 133.247.139.240, 133.247.181.128, 133.247.82.249, 133.247.15.166, 133.247.163.188, 133.247.245.115, and others.  
- ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended Security Response Plan:  
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.  
2. Deploy or update Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.  
3. Monitor the victim IP (34.55.10.218) for service degradation or outages and prepare for potential escalation.  
4. Engage upstream ISP or hosting provider to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic closer to the source.  
5. Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools or services (e.g., scrubbing services) if the attack volume increases.  
6. Log and document all attack traffic for forensic analysis and potential legal action.
