Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are two: one from 69.47.68.48 to 202.194.36.238, and one from 203.78.177.156 to 83.191.85.81. This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries are type 11 (Time Exceeded), which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 11 messages may be normal network behavior related to traceroute or TTL expiration.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Correlate with additional logs or anomaly data to detect emerging patterns.  
- Investigate the source IPs if they repeatedly send ICMP type 8 packets in high volume.
