Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries show no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets; the ICMP type field is not explicitly given but the count of ICMP type 8 packets is zero or one at most.  
- The first entry shows 1 packet with ICMP but no indication it is type 8; the second entry shows zero ICMP type 8 packets.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches.  
- The traffic does not meet the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to consider a ping flood.  

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the given data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased ICMP type 8 packet counts from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more detailed ICMP type information in logs to confirm packet types.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or repeated connection attempts from these IPs.
