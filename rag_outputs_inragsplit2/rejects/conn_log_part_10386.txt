Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is from IP 69.47.68.36 to 203.78.151.158, and there is only 1 instance of this type in the snippet, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries are types 3 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) messages may be normal network behavior or related to routing issues, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Investigate the source IP 69.47.68.36 if the number of ICMP Echo Requests increases or if other suspicious activity is detected.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging threats.
