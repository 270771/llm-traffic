Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the required type for ping floods.
- Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.39.181, 130.197.19.12, 133.247.1.214, 133.247.39.21, 133.247.236.238, 133.247.1.212, 157.17.100.161, 133.247.1.62) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to the same destination IP 35.183.65.24, indicating a coordinated flood.
- The volume and distribution of ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame strongly match known ping flood patterns, where multiple hosts send rapid ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Source IPs: 133.247.39.181, 130.197.19.12, 133.247.1.214, 133.247.39.21, 133.247.236.238, 133.247.1.212, 157.17.100.161, 133.247.1.62
- Destination IP: 35.183.65.24
- ICMP protocol, no ports applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests targeting 35.183.65.24 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs if they are not legitimate users.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood activity and correlate with other network logs to identify potential botnet involvement.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood-specific mitigation tools or services (e.g., scrubbing centers) if the attack volume increases.
