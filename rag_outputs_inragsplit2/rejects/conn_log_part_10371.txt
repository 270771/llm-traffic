Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.181.47.160) within a very short timestamp window, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Multiple source IPs from the 133.228.x.x range are sending ICMP Echo Requests simultaneously, indicating a distributed or coordinated flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination, which is clearly met here.
- The most likely heuristic number is 20 (based on the instruction referencing heuristic 20 for known anomalous IPs), and the taxonomy class is "ICMP Flood" or "Ping Flood" under Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.228.237.48, 133.228.210.10, 133.228.179.194, etc.) targeting destination IP 52.181.47.160 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16).
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host (52.181.47.160) for service degradation or outages and prepare for potential mitigation such as blackholing or scrubbing services.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources involved in the flood.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs if the attack volume escalates beyond local mitigation capabilities.
