Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from 61.1.51.193 to 115.141.182.48, and there is only one such instance in the snippet.  
- The other ICMP entry has type 0 (Echo Reply), which does not count toward ping flood detection.  
- The threshold for ping flood detection is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume over time or checking for other suspicious connection patterns.
