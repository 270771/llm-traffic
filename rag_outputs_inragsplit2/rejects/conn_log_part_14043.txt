Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at the same destination IP 68.104.133.69 from multiple source IPs within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the presence of multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting a single host aligns with common heuristic 20 (known for ping flood detection) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: multiple sources including 133.228.57.115, 133.228.128.6, 133.228.119.198, 133.228.240.88, 133.228.119.243, 133.228.57.111, 133.228.57.225, 133.228.236.62, 133.228.177.251 targeting destination 68.104.133.69 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms Echo Requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter to mitigate the flood.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP addresses temporarily.
- Monitor the target host 68.104.133.69 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct further investigation to identify if these source IPs are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.
