Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values observed are 128, 3, and 11, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are no entries with ICMP type 8, and fewer than 10 instances of any ICMP type 8 traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The observed ICMP types correspond to:  
- Type 3: Destination Unreachable (often normal network behavior or error reporting)  
- Type 11: Time Exceeded (used in traceroute or routing issues)  
- Type 128: Echo Reply (response to ping, not an attack itself)

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes or repeated ICMP Echo Requests from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any unusual ICMP error messages if they increase in frequency.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
