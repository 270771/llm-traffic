Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The two ICMP entries with type 8 (echo request) from 35.183.65.24 to two different destinations show only 1 instance each, totaling 2 instances, which is below the threshold of 10 required to confirm a ping flood.  
- The third ICMP entry is type 3 (destination unreachable), which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The low volume of ICMP echo requests does not meet the criteria for a ping flood (heuristic 20 or otherwise).  

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring ICMP traffic for increased volume or repeated echo requests from the same source IP.  
- Investigate if 35.183.65.24 is generating unusual ICMP traffic over a longer time window.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems once heuristic and taxonomy data become available.
