Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are 3, 11, and 1, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact, none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable), 11 (Time Exceeded), and 1 (Echo Reply) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are any ICMP type 8 packets in a broader timeframe or other logs.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests from or to these IPs.  
- Collect heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
