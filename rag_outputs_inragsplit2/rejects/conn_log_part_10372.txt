Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.181.47.160) from multiple source IPs within the 133.228.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic ping flood where many ICMP Echo Requests are sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting one destination) and fits the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.228.255.245, 133.228.116.245, 133.228.116.130, etc.) targeting destination IP 52.181.47.160 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping flood.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Notify the network operations team to monitor the target host (52.181.47.160) for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the source IP subnet if it is not part of legitimate traffic.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these source IPs are spoofed or part of a botnet and update firewall rules accordingly.
