Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows only one instance of ICMP traffic with no ICMP type 8 specified, and only one occurrence is logged. Since no ICMP type 8 (echo request) packets are present and the count is far below the threshold of 10, this does not meet the criteria for a ping flood.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest alternative attack types. The connection state is OTH (other), which often indicates incomplete or unusual connection termination but is insufficient to indicate an attack.

No further immediate action is required for ping flood detection. However, monitoring for increased ICMP echo requests or repeated OTH states from these IPs (203.78.182.107 and 80.142.66.223) is recommended to detect any emerging suspicious activity.
