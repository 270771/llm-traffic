Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entry is a single instance (timestamp 1641099638.152618) from 133.247.237.137 to 128.163.241.88.  
- The other ICMP entries are types 0 and 11, which are not Echo Requests and thus not relevant to ping floods.  
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 instances, and no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided to override this threshold.  
- The traffic does not match the known pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests from a source to a destination indicative of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Since no anomalies or heuristics are available, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic volume or error messages (types other than 8) that might indicate other network issues.
