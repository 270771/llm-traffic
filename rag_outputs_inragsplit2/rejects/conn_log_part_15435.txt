Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are at least 10 distinct instances targeting the same destination IP 16.160.194.189 from multiple source IPs (130.197.62.249, 130.197.172.113, 130.197.150.45, 130.197.150.36, 130.197.24.139, 130.197.55.195, 130.197.156.44), indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches the known heuristic for ping flood detection: multiple ICMP type 8 packets (â‰¥10) from various sources targeting a single destination.
- Involved IPs: Source IPs are primarily in the 130.197.x.x range; destination IP heavily targeted is 16.160.194.189. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter for the targeted IP 16.160.194.189.
  2. Block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other network logs to identify potential botnet involvement.
  4. Notify the network operations team to investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or abuse.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services if the attack persists.
