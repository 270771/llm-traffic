Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are at least 10 distinct instances of ICMP type 8 targeting the IP 35.183.65.24 from various source IPs within a very short time frame, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources including 133.247.242.212, 133.247.34.172, 133.247.152.190, 133.247.187.208, 133.247.242.216, 133.247.96.62, 133.247.34.165, 133.247.34.214, 133.247.80.121 targeting destination 35.183.65.24 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the nature of the traffic.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP echo requests at the network perimeter to mitigate the flood.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP addresses if they are not legitimate users.
- Monitor the target IP 35.183.65.24 for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
- Conduct a network-wide review to identify any compromised hosts participating in the attack and isolate them.
- Notify relevant stakeholders and prepare for potential escalation if the attack volume increases.
