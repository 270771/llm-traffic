Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 3 and 11, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are only two ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 is "Destination Unreachable" and type 11 is "Time Exceeded," which are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:
- Continue monitoring for ICMP type 8 traffic spikes.
- Investigate if any hosts show repeated ICMP errors that might indicate network issues.
- Obtain heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
