Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0, 3, and 11, but none are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 11 (Time Exceeded) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic.  
- Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP Echo Requests, especially if counts exceed 10 or involve known suspicious IPs.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy.
