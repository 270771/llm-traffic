Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV or visible in the logs.
- The only anomaly record (anomaly_782) relates to heuristic 10 (SYN attack), which involves TCP SYN floods, not ICMP ping floods.
- The traffic mostly shows TCP connection attempts with SYN flags (S0 state), and some UDP traffic on port 1900, but no ICMP traffic.

Recommendation:
- Investigate further for possible SYN flood attacks given heuristic 10 is triggered.
- Monitor for ICMP traffic separately to detect any future ping flood attempts.
- Verify if any IDS/IPS or network sensors are capturing ICMP traffic, as Zeek conn.log here does not show it.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attack, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packets.
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' in anomaly_782 relates to partial TCP connection attempts, consistent with SYN flood behavior.

No ping flood is detected; focus should be on TCP SYN anomalies and ensuring ICMP monitoring is enabled.
