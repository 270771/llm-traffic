Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.193.126.151 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (multiple sources flooding a single destination with ICMP type 8) and fits the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding" or "Ping Flood Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 133.247.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.247.110.213, 133.247.7.3, 133.247.82.249, etc.) targeting destination IP 54.193.126.151 on ICMP type 8 (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter/firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.193.126.151.
  2. Identify and isolate the source IPs involved in the flood for further investigation and possible blocking.
  3. Monitor network traffic for continued or escalating ICMP floods and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or secondary attacks.
  4. Notify the affected system owners and prepare incident response to mitigate service disruption.
