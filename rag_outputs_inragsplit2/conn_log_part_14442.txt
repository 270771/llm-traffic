Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present only twice from source IP 3.2.252.71 to two different destination IPs. This is well below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP entries have types different from 8, which do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The presence of a few ICMP echo requests is normal network behavior.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs to detect potential escalation.  
- Investigate if the source IP 3.2.252.71 is known for suspicious activity in other logs or threat intelligence feeds.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
