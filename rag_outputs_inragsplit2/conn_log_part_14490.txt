Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 128 and 3, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of 10 instances needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 3 packet (Destination Unreachable) and type 128 (Echo Reply) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding or scanning.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or repeated ICMP traffic from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any future anomalies flagged with heuristic 20 or related to ICMP traffic for potential ping flood activity.
