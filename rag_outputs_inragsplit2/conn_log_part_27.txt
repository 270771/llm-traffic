Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct connection entries all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- Multiple source IPs from the 133.16.x.x subnet are sending ICMP type 8 packets to a single destination IP 52.190.120.127 in rapid succession, matching the pattern of a distributed ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources targeting one destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple sources (e.g., 133.16.150.75, 133.16.174.114, 133.16.175.157, etc.) targeting destination 52.190.120.127 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping flood.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.16.0.0/16) to the victim IP 52.190.120.127.
2. Deploy Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signatures to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
3. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic closer to the source.
4. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or amplification.
5. Notify affected parties and prepare for potential escalation if attack volume increases.
