Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have a type field of 0 in the Zeek conn.log snippet (the 11th field is ICMP type, which is shown as "-" here, but the ICMP code is 0, and the count of packets is 1 per entry). None explicitly show ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only 3 ICMP connection entries total, each with a single packet, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.

No other attack pattern is evident from the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more detailed ICMP type and code information in logs to better identify ping floods.  
- Investigate if these IPs have other suspicious activity in different logs or timeframes.
