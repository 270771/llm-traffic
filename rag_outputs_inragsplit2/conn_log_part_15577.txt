Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the log entries are 3, 0, and 13, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only three ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (no heuristic context or anomalies found here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Further investigation could include:  
- Monitoring for ICMP type 8 packets to detect potential ping floods.  
- Checking for other ICMP-based anomalies or different protocols that might indicate other attacks.  

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned at this time.
