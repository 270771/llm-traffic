Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: Although there are multiple ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets targeting 35.169.51.96, the total count of such instances in the snippet is fewer than 10 (only 6 distinct entries with type 8). Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would lower the threshold. The presence of other ICMP types (1, 13) does not indicate a ping flood, as only type 8 is relevant.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no further classification can be made.

Next steps: Monitor for an increased volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these sources to the destination IP. If the count exceeds 10 or anomaly data emerges, re-evaluate for ping flood. Also, investigate the source IPs 133.247.179.193, 133.247.179.195, 133.247.171.166, 133.247.179.203, 133.247.238.248, and 133.247.238.189 for unusual activity patterns.
