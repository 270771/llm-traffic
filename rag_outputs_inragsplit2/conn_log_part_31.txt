Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) from source IP 133.16.14.149 to multiple destination IPs, indicating repeated ICMP echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The presence of anomaly_314 explicitly categorizes traffic from 133.16.14.149 as 'icmp_error' under heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood attack.
- The involved IP address is primarily 133.16.14.149 (source) targeting various destination IPs on ICMP type 8, port 0 (ICMP does not use ports, so port is 0 or unknown).
- This matches heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class "icmp_error" under the "Other" category, confirming the nature of the anomaly.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on 133.16.14.149 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement ICMP rate limiting and anomaly detection rules to prevent recurrence.
- Notify network operations and security teams to prepare for potential escalation or related attacks.

This is a clear case of a ping flood attack as defined by the heuristics and anomaly taxonomy provided.
