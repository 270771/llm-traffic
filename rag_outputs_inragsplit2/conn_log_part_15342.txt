Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only entry with ICMP type 8 (echo request) is the last one, with 13 instances, which meets the minimum count for a ping flood. However, the ICMP type field in the Zeek log is indicated by the number after the source IP (field 6). The last entry shows ICMP type 13, not 8. The other entries have ICMP types 1 and 3, none of which are type 8.  
- Since none of the entries have ICMP type 8, the traffic does not match the required condition for a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP types 1 and 3 correspond to destination unreachable and source quench messages, which are normal ICMP control messages, not flooding attacks.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 157.17.205.95 sending 13 ICMP packets of type 13 (timestamp request) to 159.158.28.214, as this is unusual but not a ping flood.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP echo requests (type 8) or other suspicious ICMP traffic patterns.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify ICMP anomalies in future analyses.
