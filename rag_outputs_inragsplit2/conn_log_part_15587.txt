Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (16.160.152.89) within a very short time frame, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Each connection originates from a different source IP within the 133.228.x.x range, indicating a distributed or spoofed source scenario typical in ping floods.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is clearly met here.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as a "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, specifically an ICMP flood.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.228.172.59, 133.228.184.57, 133.228.232.41, etc.) targeting destination IP 16.160.152.89 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target host (16.160.152.89) for service degradation or outages and prepare for potential escalation.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other possible victims or sources involved in the attack.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the attacking IPs if they are confirmed malicious and not legitimate users.
