Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (161.67.57.135) within a very short time window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type 8 is the only type associated with ping requests, and the volume here exceeds the threshold of 10 instances, confirming the flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet are flooding the destination IP 161.67.57.135. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are 0 or not applicable.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking rules on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to drop ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16).
- Monitor the target host (161.67.57.135) for service degradation or outages.
- Engage upstream ISP to filter or throttle the malicious traffic if possible.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts within the source IP range that may be participating in the attack.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to automatically respond to similar future events.
