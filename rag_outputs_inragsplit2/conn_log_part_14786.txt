Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows an ICMP type of 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one instance of this ICMP traffic, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest other suspicious activity.

No other attack type is evident from this single log entry. The ICMP type 11 typically relates to traceroute or TTL expiration, not flooding.

No further immediate action is required for ping flood detection. However, monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (202.20.241.227) to the destination (203.78.177.156) is recommended to detect any emerging ping flood attempts.
