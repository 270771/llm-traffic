Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field (the 8th column after the timestamp and UID) shows mostly values of 3 and 11, not 8. ICMP type 8 corresponds to Echo Request (ping), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two entries with ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) and none with type 8.  
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. ICMP types 3 and 11 are typically related to destination unreachable and time exceeded messages, which can be normal network behavior or related to routing issues, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 for unusual ICMP activity or other protocols if suspicious behavior continues.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets or other anomalies.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
