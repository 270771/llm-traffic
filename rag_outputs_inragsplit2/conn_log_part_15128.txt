Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 0 and 8 (from the snippet: one entry with ICMP type 0 and one with type 11). Only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is relevant for ping floods.  
- There is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to consider a ping flood, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristics are indicated.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) is typically related to traceroute or routing issues, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Investigate if any IPs appear repeatedly with ICMP Echo Requests exceeding the threshold.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect patterns over time.
