Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packet is from 163.171.168.73 to 163.252.12.9, and there is only one instance, which is well below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.
- The other ICMP packet is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not relevant to ping floods.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.
- Without multiple ICMP type 8 packets or matching heuristics, this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.
- Investigate if any new anomaly records or heuristics become available that flag these IPs.
- Continue logging and analyzing ICMP traffic volume and types for early detection of potential flooding.
