Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (18.34.27.210) within a very short timestamp window, which matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The source IPs are numerous and varied, indicating a distributed source of ICMP echo requests, consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources to a single target) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range; destination IP: 18.34.27.210; ICMP type: 8 (Echo Request).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 18.34.27.210.
- Engage upstream ISP or DDoS mitigation service to filter or absorb the flood traffic.
- Monitor the affected host and network for service degradation or outages.
- Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify potential compromised hosts in the 157.17.x.x range that may be participating in the attack.
