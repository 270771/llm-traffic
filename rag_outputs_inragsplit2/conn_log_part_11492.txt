Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 3.83.92.175 from multiple source IPs within the 133.228.x.x subnet. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- No anomalies or heuristic references are explicitly provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.228.205.222, 133.228.190.8, 133.228.130.230, etc.) targeting destination IP 3.83.92.175 on ICMP type 8 (Echo Request). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source subnet (133.228.0.0/16) to the victim IP 3.83.92.175.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other network logs to identify potential botnet involvement.
  3. Notify network operations to investigate and potentially block offending source IPs upstream.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns automatically.
  5. Review firewall and router configurations to ensure ICMP traffic is controlled according to organizational policy.
