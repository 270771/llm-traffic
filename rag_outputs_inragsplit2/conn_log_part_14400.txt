Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the log is `11`, which corresponds to "Time Exceeded" messages, not type `8` (Echo Request) required for ping floods.  
- Only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single ICMP Time Exceeded message. This could be normal network behavior or a traceroute-related packet.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if the source IP 203.78.180.178 or destination 52.181.50.194 appear in future logs with suspicious patterns.  
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy.
