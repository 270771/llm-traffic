Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.76.120.97) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (as per your instructions: known anomalous src or dst IPs matching heuristic 20 can reduce the threshold, but here the count is well above 10 regardless).
- Taxonomy class is most likely "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack, specifically an ICMP flood.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.76.120.97 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.21.x.x and other ranges.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 163.76.120.97 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any signs of service degradation on the destination IPs.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
4. Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to prevent recurrence.
5. Notify affected network owners of the destination IPs to prepare for potential impact.

This is a clear case of an ongoing ICMP ping flood attack requiring urgent mitigation.
