Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.254.250.38) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The rapid succession and volume of ICMP Echo Requests to many different targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies: "ICMP flood detected by volume and type").
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.254.250.38; Destination IPs include 163.252.213.172, 163.252.60.6, 163.252.213.145, 163.252.213.164, 163.252.31.93, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 54.254.250.38 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source IP to determine if it is part of a botnet or compromised host.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting to catch similar future events early.
- Consider deploying ICMP rate limiting or filtering policies to mitigate volumetric ICMP attacks.
