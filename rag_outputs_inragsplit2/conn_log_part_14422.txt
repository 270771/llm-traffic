Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic context states that at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 must be present unless heuristic 20 (ping flood) is explicitly triggered by known anomalous IPs, which is not the case here.  
- The only anomaly record present (anomaly_782) relates to a SYN attack (heuristic 10) on port 8080, unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packets, not ICMP traffic.  
- No heuristic 20 (ping flood) anomalies or ICMP traffic are detected.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) further by reviewing traffic from source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 for potential SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Enable or collect ICMP-specific logs to monitor for possible ping flood attempts in the future.
