Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records reference anomalies on TCP ports 23 and 443 with heuristics 999 and 504, neither of which correspond to heuristic 20 (ping flood).
- Heuristic 20 explicitly relates to ICMP Echo Request floods, which are absent here.
- The anomalies detected (heuristic 999 and 504) relate to "mptmp" category and HTTPS traffic, not ICMP or ping floods.

Next steps:
- Investigate the anomalous TCP traffic from source IP 107.81.9.228 on port 23 (Telnet) flagged by heuristic 999 for potential unauthorized access attempts.
- Review firewall and IDS logs for any unusual TCP SYN or RST floods, as multiple TCP connection attempts with flags S0, SH, and RSTR are present.
- Confirm if the anomaly heuristic 999 corresponds to a known exploit or scanning activity.

No ping flood is detected; the current anomalies relate to suspicious TCP traffic on known ports, not ICMP flooding.
