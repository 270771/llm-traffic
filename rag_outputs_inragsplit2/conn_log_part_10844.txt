Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8. In the snippet, multiple entries have ICMP type 8 as the source port (indicating echo requests), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, the total count of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source IP to multiple destinations is fewer than 10 instances per source IP. For example, 35.100.170.152 sends 7 ICMP type 8 packets to different destinations, which is below the threshold of 10 required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present (and no anomaly records were found).  
- The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests distributed across multiple targets, possibly legitimate network scanning or monitoring rather than flooding.

Since no anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are available, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The lack of repeated, high-volume ICMP type 8 traffic from a single source IP to a single or small set of destination IPs indicates no ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if the multiple ICMP echo requests from 35.100.170.152 are part of legitimate network diagnostics or benign scanning.  
- Monitor for any increase in volume or concentration of ICMP type 8 packets from any source IP that might indicate evolving attack behavior.  
- Correlate with other logs or IDS alerts for potential reconnaissance or other ICMP-based attacks.
