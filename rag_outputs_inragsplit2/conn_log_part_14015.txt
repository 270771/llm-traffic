Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. There are well over 10 instances targeting the same destination IPs (notably 34.25.86.31 and 35.173.100.241), consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The ICMP type is exclusively 8 in these entries (except one unrelated ICMP type 1 and 2), confirming these are ping requests, not other ICMP message types.
- The volume and distribution of source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets to a single destination IP strongly indicate a coordinated ping flood attack.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources to a single target) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IP addresses and ports:
- Target IPs: 34.25.86.31 and 35.173.100.241 (destination port 0 for ICMP)
- Multiple source IPs from 157.17.x.x and 133.247.x.x subnets among others.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from suspicious source IP ranges.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Monitor the affected hosts (34.25.86.31 and 35.173.100.241) for service degradation or outages.
- Consider blacklisting persistent attacking source IPs at firewall or router level.
- Engage upstream ISP to assist in filtering or blocking attack traffic if volume is large.
- Review and update incident response playbooks for ICMP flood attacks to ensure rapid mitigation.
