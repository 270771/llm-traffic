Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 3.83.92.175 from multiple source IPs within the 133.228.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the observed behavior aligns with a common heuristic for ICMP flood attacks: multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources targeting one host.
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.228.147.189, 133.228.240.104, 133.228.174.0, etc.) flooding destination IP 3.83.92.175 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 3.83.92.175.
- Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing; consider blacklisting or blocking suspicious sources.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for broader attack context.
- Notify the affected system owner to prepare for potential service degradation or denial of service.
