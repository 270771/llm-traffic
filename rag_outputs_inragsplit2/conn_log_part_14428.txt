Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance, far below the threshold of 10 for ping flood detection. No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

This traffic does not match ping flood patterns but indicates a possible network error or scanning activity (ICMP type 3). Without heuristic context, this aligns with a benign or diagnostic ICMP message rather than an attack.

No immediate security response for ping flood is needed. Further investigation could focus on why the destination unreachable message was generated, checking for misconfigurations or network issues involving IPs 133.228.208.30 and 139.64.157.46.
