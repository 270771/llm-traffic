Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests (echo request) must be 8. In the provided conn.log snippet, only one entry shows ICMP type 8 (last line: src IP 15.146.150.124 to dst IP 203.65.103.15).  
- There are not at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8, which is the threshold for detecting a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (no heuristic or anomaly data is available here).  
- Most ICMP entries have type 3 (Destination Unreachable) or type 11 (Time Exceeded), which are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The presence of multiple ICMP type 3 messages may indicate network scanning or misconfiguration but does not constitute a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 15.146.150.124 for any unusual ICMP echo request activity over a longer time window.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets to or from any IPs.  
- Collect heuristic and anomaly context to better classify ICMP anomalies in the future.
