Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed in the conn.log snippet are 11, 13, and 3, none of which are type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact, none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types seen correspond to:  
- Type 11: Time Exceeded (often normal or traceroute-related)  
- Type 13: Timestamp Request  
- Type 3: Destination Unreachable  

These do not match typical ping flood behavior.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are other logs or data sources showing ICMP type 8 traffic in high volume.  
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests from or to these IPs.  
- If anomalies appear, correlate with heuristic 20 or other known ping flood indicators once available.
