Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP traffic entries with type 8 (Echo Request), which is required to identify a ping flood.  
- All entries are TCP or UDP; the protocol field (last column) shows 6 (TCP) or 17 (UDP), no ICMP (protocol 1) entries are present.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV or logs. The only heuristic mentioned is 10 (SYN attack) related to a different IP and port, unrelated to ICMP.  
- Without at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or matching heuristic 20 anomalies, the criteria for ping flood detection are not met.

The anomaly with heuristic 10 corresponds to a SYN attack (TCP SYN flood), which is a different type of DoS attack involving TCP SYN packets, not ICMP. This is consistent with the SYN flags and TCP traffic seen in the logs.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly further by reviewing connection attempts from source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 for potential TCP SYN flood activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.  
- Confirm no ICMP type 8 packets are present in other logs or timeframes to rule out stealthy ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 stands for SYN attack, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packet floods.  
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' relates to partial or temporary anomalies, often linked to port or flag irregularities.

No ping flood is detected at this time.
