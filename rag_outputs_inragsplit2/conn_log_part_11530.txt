Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP 34.25.134.27, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the count exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to identify a ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range targeting destination IP 34.25.134.27 on ICMP type 8 (no ports for ICMP).
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 34.25.134.27.
  2. Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IPs involved in the flood.
  3. Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and availability.
  4. Consider deploying an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation.
