Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly record references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080, which corresponds to a SYN flood or TCP-based attack, not ICMP ping flood.  
- Heuristic 10 indicates a SYN attack, and taxonomy class 'ptmp' suggests partial TCP message patterns, consistent with SYN flood behavior.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 further for potential SYN flood or TCP-based DoS activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect possible ping floods in the future.  
- Verify firewall and IDS rules to ensure SYN flood protections are active and tuned.

No ping flood is detected; the current anomaly matches a SYN attack (heuristic 10), which should be addressed accordingly.
