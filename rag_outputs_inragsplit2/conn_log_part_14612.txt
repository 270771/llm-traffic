Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 161.67.57.135, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomalies or heuristic data are explicitly provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.188.83, 157.17.60.6, 157.17.160.75, etc.) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 161.67.57.135 on ICMP port 0 (ICMP does not use ports, but Zeek logs 0 here).
- Recommended response: Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from these source IPs. Additionally, deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests. Notify network operations to monitor the target host for service degradation and consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the identified sources if the attack persists.
