Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests is 8. In the snippet, there are only 4 entries with ICMP type 8 (from source IPs 133.228.202.76, 133.228.82.122, 133.228.76.59, and 133.228.76.222) targeting 68.104.133.69. This is fewer than the threshold of 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry (from 202.194.17.61 to 49.116.66.16) is type 0 (echo reply), which does not indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack patterns are evident from the data. The traffic appears to be isolated ICMP echo requests rather than a volumetric flood.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same or multiple sources to the same destination.  
- Investigate if the destination IP 68.104.133.69 is experiencing any service degradation or unusual network load.  
- Collect more data to confirm or rule out emerging ICMP-based attacks.
