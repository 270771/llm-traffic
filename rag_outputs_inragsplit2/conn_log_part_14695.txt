Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from source IP 133.247.49.34 to destination 23.214.98.253, but there is only 1 such instance in the snippet, which is below the threshold of 10 required to indicate a ping flood.
- The other ICMP entry has type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not relevant for ping flood detection.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.
- Without multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination, this traffic does not match the pattern of a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests emerges.
- Investigate the source IP 133.247.49.34 if it continues to send ICMP Echo Requests at a high rate.
