Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the ICMP type used for ping. This meets the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider a ping flood.
- The destination IP 54.184.243.206 is repeatedly targeted by multiple source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets in rapid succession, consistent with a distributed ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by standard taxonomy, this matches a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via ICMP flood.
- The most likely heuristic number to assign is 20 (as referenced in the instructions for known anomalous IPs), indicating a ping flood attack.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range targeting destination IP 54.184.243.206 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is critical here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets targeting the victim IP.
- Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block traffic from the attacking IP ranges if possible.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other logs for potential escalation.
- Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Requests on critical infrastructure if not required for operations.
