Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 17 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.193.126.151, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple ICMP Echo Requests overwhelm a target.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP Echo Request flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range and one in 85.61.2.107 (though that one is ICMP type 11, not type 8), all targeting destination IP 54.193.126.151 on ICMP protocol.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic from many sources to one destination is indicative of a distributed ping flood.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 54.193.126.151.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the source IP addresses involved in the flood.
- Monitor for collateral impact on network performance and availability.
- Deploy or tune intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to alert on similar ICMP flood patterns.
- Coordinate with upstream providers or ISPs to filter malicious traffic closer to the source if possible.
