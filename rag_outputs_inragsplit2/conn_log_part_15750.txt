Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have types 3 and 0, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The entries show isolated ICMP messages (type 3 = Destination Unreachable, type 0 = Echo Reply), which are normal network control messages.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same or other IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs and anomaly data to detect potential scanning or denial-of-service attempts.  
- Investigate if any heuristic 20 or other known suspicious IPs appear in future logs.
