Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all originating from the single source IP 163.171.168.73 targeting multiple destination IPs. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame matches the known behavior of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the detection aligns with the known heuristic that at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 from the same source IP indicate a ping flood.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.171.168.73; multiple destination IPs including 163.252.132.21, 203.78.190.227, 202.194.37.36, and others. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this IP or other suspicious sources.
  3. Investigate the source host 163.171.168.73 for compromise or misuse.
  4. Notify network operations to prepare for potential collateral impact on network performance.
  5. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
