Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.228.253.198, 133.228.204.111, 18.112.90.42) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to a single destination IP 3.83.92.175, indicating a distributed ping flood pattern.
- The volume and concentration of ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame strongly match known ping flood attack behavior.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this matches heuristic 20 (known from your instructions) related to ping flood detection by ICMP type and volume.
- Taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack due to the nature of ICMP flooding.

Involved IPs and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple, including 133.228.253.198, 133.228.204.111, 18.112.90.42, and others.
- Destination IP: 3.83.92.175
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Deploy or tune existing DoS mitigation tools to detect and drop excessive ICMP traffic targeting 3.83.92.175.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts within the source IP ranges that may be participating in the attack.
- Notify the affected network owner (3.83.92.175) and coordinate for further incident response.
- Monitor for any escalation or changes in attack vectors, including other ICMP types or protocols.
