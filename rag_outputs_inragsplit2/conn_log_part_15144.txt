Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (Time Exceeded) indicated by the destination port 0 and no ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries. Since the ICMP type is not 8 and there is only one instance, it does not meet the criteria for a ping flood attack, which requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or matching heuristic 20 anomalous IPs.

No anomalies or heuristics are present in the provided data to suggest another attack type. Further investigation could include monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to detect potential ping floods or other ICMP-based reconnaissance.
