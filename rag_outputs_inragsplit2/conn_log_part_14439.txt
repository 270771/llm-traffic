Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 13, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable messages, and type 13 is Timestamp Request, which are normal control messages and not indicative of flooding.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be made. However, it is recommended to continue monitoring for ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) and check for any sudden spikes in such traffic to detect potential ping floods early.
