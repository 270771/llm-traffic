Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice from source IP 157.161.40.85 to different destinations, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood.  
- The majority of ICMP entries from 203.65.114.222 have ICMP type 0 or other types, not type 8, so they do not qualify as ping flood traffic.  
- There is one anomaly record (anomaly_104) related to destination IP 218.243.155.95 with heuristic 20, which corresponds to ping flood, but the conn.log snippet shows only a single ICMP type 10 (which is not type 8) to that IP, so it does not confirm an ongoing ping flood here.

Heuristic and taxonomy context:  
- Heuristic 20 stands for ping flood detection based on ICMP traffic volume and type.  
- The anomaly taxonomy "ntscICecrqICecrprp" relates to NetworkScanICMP, indicating suspicious ICMP scanning or probing activity rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 further, as it generates a high volume of ICMP traffic with various types, which may indicate scanning or reconnaissance activity.  
- Correlate with other logs or longer time windows to check if ICMP type 8 traffic increases beyond the threshold.  
- Monitor the destination IP 218.243.155.95 for repeated ICMP anomalies to confirm or rule out ping flood attempts.
