Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connection records; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference ICMP traffic or heuristic 20 (Ping flood); they mention heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (unknown), both unrelated to ICMP ping floods.
- Heuristic 20 explicitly corresponds to ping flood attacks, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets; none are observed here.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack indicated by heuristic 10 in anomaly_782, as SYN floods can cause denial of service.
- Review TCP flags and connection attempts for possible SYN flood mitigation.
- Monitor for any future ICMP traffic to detect potential ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, characterized by abnormal SYN packets.
- Heuristic 20 corresponds to ping flood attacks, requiring multiple ICMP type 8 packets.
- The current data matches heuristic 10 but not heuristic 20.

No ping flood is detected; focus should be on investigating the SYN attack anomaly further.
