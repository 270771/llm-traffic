Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries with type 8 (Echo Request) are present, but the total count of such instances targeting a single destination IP (13.86.188.134) is around 10 or slightly more, which is borderline but not definitively a flood.
- The ICMP type 8 packets are spread across multiple source IPs, but the volume and frequency do not clearly exceed the threshold of at least 10 instances from a single source or in aggregate to confirm a flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to indicate known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches that would lower the threshold.
- Other ICMP types (3, 11) are present but do not indicate ping flood activity.

Since no anomaly data or heuristics are available, the default assumption is that this traffic is normal or low-volume ICMP echo requests, possibly legitimate network diagnostics or scanning.

Next steps:
- Monitor the volume and frequency of ICMP type 8 packets over a longer time window to detect any sudden spikes.
- Investigate the source IPs sending repeated ICMP echo requests to 13.86.188.134 for potential reconnaissance activity.
- If heuristic 20 or other heuristics become available, re-evaluate with that context.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- Without explicit heuristics, the default taxonomy for ICMP echo request floods would be "Denial of Service" (DoS).
- Heuristic 20 (if known) typically relates to suspicious IP behavior or known malicious sources.

No immediate security incident is detected, but continued monitoring is advised.
