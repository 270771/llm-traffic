Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All ICMP entries have type 8 (Echo Request), which is consistent with ping traffic.  
- However, there are only 8 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IP (161.67.57.135), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (e.g., heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests, possibly legitimate pings or low-volume scanning.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP echo request volume to the same destination IP to detect potential escalation into a ping flood.  
- Investigate the source IPs if they repeatedly send ICMP requests or if other anomalies arise.  
- Collect and correlate additional logs or anomaly data to identify emerging threats.
