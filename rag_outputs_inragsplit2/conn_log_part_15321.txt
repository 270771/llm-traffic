Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning: The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) entries are present but only in small quantities per source IP, with no single source generating at least 10 instances. The total count of ICMP type 8 packets is fewer than 10 in the snippet, and no known anomalous source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 are present (no anomaly data found). Other ICMP types (3) are unrelated to ping floods.

Since no anomaly or heuristic context is provided, no specific heuristic or taxonomy can be assigned. The traffic does not match a ping flood pattern, which requires a high volume of ICMP Echo Requests from one or multiple sources targeting a destination.

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume or repeated requests from the same IPs. Investigate any future anomalies related to ICMP traffic, especially if heuristic 20 or similar is identified.
