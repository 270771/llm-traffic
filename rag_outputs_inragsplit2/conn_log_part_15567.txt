Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 13 (ICMP code 13 corresponds to "Timestamp Request"), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, there is only one ICMP instance logged, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristics are present to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from this single ICMP entry. Without heuristic context or anomaly data, no further classification is possible.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Collect more data to identify any emerging patterns.
