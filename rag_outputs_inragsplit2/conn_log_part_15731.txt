Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is the 4th column after the source IP. The entries show ICMP types 8, 11, and 11. Only ICMP type 8 corresponds to an echo request (ping).  
- There is only one instance of ICMP type 8 (from 62.31.166.36 to 203.78.187.167). The other two entries are ICMP type 11 (time exceeded), which are not ping requests and thus not part of a ping flood.  
- The threshold for detecting a ping flood is at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances unless heuristic 20 applies, but no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristics are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. ICMP type 11 messages may indicate traceroute or routing issues but are not inherently malicious.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.  
- Investigate the source IP 62.31.166.36 if it repeatedly sends ICMP echo requests in a short time frame.
