Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 3, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries total, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to indicate a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded messages, and type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable messages, which are normal control messages rather than flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate if there are other logs with ICMP type 8 traffic or higher volume from these IPs.  
- Monitor for any sudden increase in ICMP Echo Requests or anomalies related to these IPs.  
- Collect heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
