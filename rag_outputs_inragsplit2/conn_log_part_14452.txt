Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any ICMP or ping flood-related anomalies; the closest heuristics are 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (other), none matching heuristic 20 (ping flood).
- Heuristic 20 explicitly corresponds to ping flood attacks, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets from or to suspicious IPs.
- The logs show many SYN (S0) TCP connection attempts, consistent with SYN scanning or SYN flood attempts, matching heuristic 10 (SYN attack) taxonomy 'ptmp' in anomaly_782 and anomaly_2012.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of SYN connection attempts from IPs such as 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 (anomaly_782) as potential SYN flood or scanning activity.
- Collect and analyze ICMP traffic logs separately to confirm or rule out ping flood attacks.
- Monitor for any ICMP type 8 packets exceeding the threshold of 10 instances from/to suspicious IPs to detect future ping floods.
