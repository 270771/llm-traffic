Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) directed toward the same destination IP 68.104.133.69, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack (multiple ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame).
- No anomalies or heuristic context were explicitly provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x subnet (e.g., 133.228.169.111, 133.228.205.210, 133.228.236.56, etc.) targeting destination IP 68.104.133.69 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the ping flood nature.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests targeting 68.104.133.69 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP subnet 133.228.0.0/16 if they are not trusted.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with other network logs to identify potential botnet involvement.
- Notify network operations and consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic if the attack volume escalates.
- Conduct a post-incident review to update detection rules and improve automated response capabilities.
