Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 15 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP, 35.183.65.24, from multiple source IPs in the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests in a short time frame to one target matches the classic ping flood behavior.
- All ICMP types involved are type 8, satisfying the requirement that only ICMP type 8 indicates ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to one destination) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: multiple sources (e.g., 133.247.157.239, 133.247.109.61, 133.247.25.121, etc.) targeting destination 35.183.65.24. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.247.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the target host 35.183.65.24 for service degradation or outages.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as ICMP rate limiting or anomaly-based IDS rules.
- Conduct network traffic analysis to identify if these sources are compromised hosts or part of a botnet.
- Notify upstream providers or coordinate with network teams to filter malicious traffic closer to the source.
