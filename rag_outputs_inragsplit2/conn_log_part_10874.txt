Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type for ping requests must be 8. In the log, some entries have ICMP type 8 as the source port (e.g., 35.100.170.152 → 163.252.0.62), but the total count of such ICMP type 8 packets is fewer than 10 instances.  
- Some entries show ICMP type 0 or other values, which do not correspond to ping requests and thus are not part of a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would lower the threshold for detection.  
- The traffic volume and timing do not indicate a flood pattern; for example, the highest count of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source is below the threshold.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The lack of anomaly records and heuristic context prevents further classification.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from any single source IP to detect potential future ping floods.  
- Investigate the sources of ICMP type 0 packets (e.g., 133.247.65.158 → 43.202.248.60) to rule out other ICMP-based reconnaissance or misconfigurations.  
- Collect and correlate additional logs or anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
