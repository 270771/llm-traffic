Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 11 (ICMP code 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded, not type 8 Echo Request), and only one instance is present. A ping flood requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here. No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is indicated by this log entry. The connection state is OTH (other), and no suspicious behavior is evident from this single ICMP packet.

No further investigation for ping flood is warranted based on this data. However, monitoring for multiple ICMP type 8 packets or additional anomaly records is recommended to detect potential future ping floods.
