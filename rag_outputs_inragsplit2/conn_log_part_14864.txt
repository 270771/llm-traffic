Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise. The connection state is OTH (other), and no repeated or sustained ICMP traffic is evident.

No other attack type is indicated by this single ICMP packet. Without multiple echo requests or known anomalous IPs, this traffic appears benign or normal network activity.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source or to the same destination. If multiple such packets appear rapidly, re-evaluate for potential ping flood using heuristic 20 or other relevant heuristics once available.
