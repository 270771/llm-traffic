Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which meets the threshold of 10 instances for ping flood detection.
- Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.16.14.149, 192.0.46.x, 157.78.x.x) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to various destination IPs, indicating a distributed pattern consistent with a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV identifies heuristic 20 ("Ping flood") associated with suspicious IPs such as 133.16.14.149 and destination 18.98.73.236, confirming the relevance of this heuristic.
- The taxonomy class "mptmp" (MultiPoints) and "icmp_error" are linked to these anomalies, supporting the classification of this traffic as a ping flood attack.

Involved IP addresses:
- Source IPs: 133.16.14.149, 192.0.46.1, 192.0.46.36, 192.0.46.37, 192.0.47.49, 192.0.47.249, 157.78.69.33, 157.78.78.187, 54.70.248.140, 203.114.140.137
- Destination IPs: 18.98.73.236, 23.65.249.250, 23.224.81.247, 23.86.126.3, 23.88.42.251, 184.200.242.253, 184.204.168.3, 186.251.221.79, 18.55.36.47

Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 traffic and volume indicate flooding.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at network perimeter devices to mitigate the flood.
2. Block or throttle traffic from identified suspicious source IPs, especially 133.16.14.149 and the 192.0.46.x/192.0.47.x subnet, pending further investigation.
3. Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP anomalies and correlate with IDS/IPS alerts.
4. Conduct a forensic analysis on affected hosts to check for compromise or participation in the attack.
5. Notify upstream providers or peers if attack traffic originates externally to coordinate mitigation.
6. Update firewall and intrusion detection signatures to detect and block similar ICMP flood patterns in the future.

This attack matches heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class "mptmp" (MultiPoints), indicating a distributed ICMP flood targeting multiple destinations.
