Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from source IP 18.22.151.10 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP Echo Requests to multiple destination IPs within the same subnet strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP Echo Requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP Echo Requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" based on standard ICMP flood attack classifications.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 18.22.151.10; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range; ICMP protocol, type 8 (Echo Request).

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 18.22.151.10 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host 18.22.151.10 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement network-level ICMP flood detection and alerting rules to prevent recurrence.
- Notify relevant incident response teams to coordinate containment and remediation.
