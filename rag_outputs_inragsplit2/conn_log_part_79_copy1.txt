Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.76.120.97) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP without known exceptions.
- The involved IP address is the source 163.76.120.97 sending ICMP echo requests to multiple destination IPs (e.g., 163.21.208.46, 203.65.116.167, 163.21.221.213, etc.). Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 163.76.120.97 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts or malware on 163.76.120.97.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP anomalies and correlate with other logs for lateral movement or additional attack vectors.
  4. Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or mitigation steps.
