Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All entries in the Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV or visible in the logs.  
- The only anomaly present (anomaly_782) relates to a SYN attack (heuristic 10) on port 8080 from IP 89.3.89.164, which is unrelated to ICMP or ping floods.

Recommendation:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly further by reviewing connection attempts from 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 for potential SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect possible ping floods.  
- Confirm if ICMP logging is enabled and properly captured in Zeek to ensure visibility of ICMP-based attacks.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packets.  
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' in anomaly_782 suggests partial or incomplete connection attempts, consistent with SYN flood behavior.
