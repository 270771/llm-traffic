Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 161.67.57.135 from multiple source IPs within a very short timestamp window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood where many echo requests overwhelm the target.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, which is required for ping flood detection.
- The volume exceeds the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets, confirming the attack.
- No known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, so the count threshold applies.
- Although the anomaly CSV does not explicitly reference ICMP or ping floods, the heuristic 999 and taxonomy 'poscaUDP' are unrelated here, so assign heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Network Denial of Service" as the most likely.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range (e.g., 157.17.221.242, 157.17.200.195, 157.17.174.242, etc.) are flooding the destination IP 161.67.57.135 with ICMP echo requests. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP.
  
Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or ICMP traffic filtering on network perimeter devices to block or throttle ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP range.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signature to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Monitor the target IP 161.67.57.135 for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify and isolate compromised hosts within the 157.17.0.0/16 subnet that may be participating in the attack.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral attacks.
