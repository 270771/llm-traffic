Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the Zeek conn.log snippet is the 4th column after the source IP (e.g., `3.89.103.26	8` means ICMP type 8). Only two entries show ICMP type 8:  
  - `3.89.103.26` → `203.78.171.216` (ICMP type 8)  
  - `3.89.103.26` → `203.78.181.209` (ICMP type 8)  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- Other ICMP types present (0, 11) do not indicate ping requests and thus are irrelevant for ping flood detection.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. The presence of ICMP type 11 (time exceeded) and type 0 (echo reply) is normal in network diagnostics and does not imply an attack.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the source IP `3.89.103.26` repeatedly sends ICMP echo requests in a short time frame, as this could escalate into a ping flood.  
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly detection systems once heuristic and taxonomy data become available.
