Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The only ICMP entry with type 8 (echo request) is a single instance:  
  `1641099675.762288 ... 52.236.221.123 ... 8 ... icmp ... 8 8 ...`  
  There is only 1 occurrence of ICMP type 8, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.
- Other ICMP entries have types 11 and 0, which are not echo requests and thus not relevant to ping flood detection.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack patterns are evident from the snippet. The heuristic for ping flood requires multiple ICMP echo requests (type 8) to the same or multiple targets, which is not met here.

Next steps:
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets.
- Investigate if the single ICMP echo request is part of a legitimate network diagnostic or isolated event.
- If more data becomes available, re-evaluate for potential ping flood or other ICMP-based anomalies.
