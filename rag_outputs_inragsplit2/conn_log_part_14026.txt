Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 54.206.231.130 within a very short time frame (all timestamps around 1641099662.28-1641099662.29). This pattern matches a classic ping flood where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records are present, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from many sources to one destination) and falls under the taxonomy class of "ICMP Flooding / Denial of Service."
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one destination IP 54.206.231.130. ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) is used, no ports are relevant for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 54.206.231.130.
  2. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  3. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests.
  4. Notify network operations to monitor for service degradation on 54.206.231.130.
  5. Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from the identified source IP ranges if attack persists.
