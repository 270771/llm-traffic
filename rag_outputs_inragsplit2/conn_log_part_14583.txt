Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 0, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8; in fact, none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 0 (Echo Reply) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if the source IP 202.194.36.224 or 45.32.19.188 have prior suspicious activity in other logs.  
- Collect more data to confirm if any anomaly emerges related to ICMP traffic patterns.
