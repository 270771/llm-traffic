Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not indicate any heuristic 20 (Ping flood) matches; the closest heuristics are 10 (SYN attack) and 504 (HTTPS traffic).
- The traffic mostly involves TCP SYN packets with S0 state, indicating connection attempts but no ICMP flooding.

Heuristic and taxonomy references:
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks (TCP SYN flood).
- Heuristic 504 corresponds to HTTPS traffic anomalies.
- No evidence of ICMP-based anomalies or ping flood heuristics.

Next steps:
- Investigate the high volume of TCP SYN packets from IPs like 167.249.133.167 and 93.81.158.106 for possible SYN flood or scanning activity.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for SYN flood detection.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
