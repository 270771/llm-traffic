Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 52.236.221.123, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- No anomalies or heuristic data are explicitly provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP type 8 packets from diverse sources to a single destination) and falls under the taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range and one source from 223.137.139.194 (though that one is ICMP type 11, not type 8, so excluded), all targeting destination IP 52.236.221.123 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the key field is ICMP type 8 (Echo Request).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 52.236.221.123.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Monitor the network for additional sources of ICMP floods and consider blacklisting persistent offenders.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or mitigate the attack traffic if it originates externally.
- Conduct a post-incident review to assess any impact on the target host and strengthen defenses against future ICMP flood attacks.
