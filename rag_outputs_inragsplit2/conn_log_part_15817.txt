Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 10 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the single destination IP 69.47.68.228 from multiple source IPs within a very short time window. This pattern matches a classic ICMP ping flood, where numerous echo requests overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances, which is met here.
- Involved IPs: multiple sources (130.197.154.156, 130.197.154.135, 130.197.24.234, 130.197.172.117, 130.197.25.30, 130.197.158.21, 130.197.54.165, 130.197.21.159, 130.197.250.6, and 157.187.138.187) targeting destination 69.47.68.228 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms echo requests.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP echo requests at the network perimeter to mitigate the flood.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IPs temporarily.
- Monitor the target host 69.47.68.228 for service degradation or outages.
- Investigate upstream network devices and coordinate with ISP to trace and block malicious traffic sources.
- Deploy or update intrusion detection/prevention systems with signatures for ICMP flood detection.
- Consider enabling ICMP flood protection features on firewalls and routers.
