Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP 52.175.248.229, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from diverse sources targeting one IP) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x and 203.78.x.x ranges sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 52.175.248.229 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests to 52.175.248.229.
  2. Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP echo requests.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for potential compromise or spoofing.
  4. Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or block malicious traffic upstream if possible.
  5. Monitor network and host performance for signs of degradation or service impact.
