Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have type values of 0, 3, or 11; none have ICMP type 8, which is required for echo request (ping) packets.
- The number of ICMP type 8 packets is zero, well below the threshold of at least 10 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20).
- The traffic appears to be various ICMP error messages (type 3 = destination unreachable, type 11 = time exceeded), which do not indicate a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data. The ICMP traffic is likely normal network diagnostic or error reporting.

Next steps:
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.
- Investigate the source IP 203.65.114.222 if it continues to generate high volumes of ICMP error messages, as it may indicate network issues or misconfigurations.
- Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to better classify future anomalies.
