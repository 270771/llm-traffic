Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from IP 130.197.139.94 to 54.16.160.215, and it appears only once.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 1 (Echo Reply), which is not relevant for ping flood detection.  
- The threshold for ping flood detection requires at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are involved, which is not the case here.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack patterns are evident from the given data. Further investigation could include monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume over time or checking other logs for related anomalies.
