Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 13, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, both with different types, and no repeated ICMP type 8 packets.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without heuristic or anomaly context, no further classification can be made.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods.  
- Investigate if ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded) or 13 (Timestamp) traffic is unusually high, as it may indicate other network issues or reconnaissance.
