Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 128, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8, in fact none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and type 128 (ICMPv6 Echo Request) do not match ping flood criteria, and the volume is minimal.

Next steps:  
- Investigate further if additional logs show repeated ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP to the same destination IP.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests or anomalies in traffic volume.  
- Obtain heuristic and taxonomy context to better classify future anomalies.
