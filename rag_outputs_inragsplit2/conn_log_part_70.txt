Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The conn.log snippet shows at least 10 ICMP connections from source IP 133.16.14.149 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which matches the requirement for a ping flood attack.
- The traffic pattern is consistent with a ping flood: multiple ICMP Echo Requests sent rapidly to various destination IPs, indicating an attempt to overwhelm targets with ICMP traffic.
- The anomaly CSV identifies source IP 133.16.14.149 as suspicious under heuristic 20, which corresponds exactly to a ping flood attack.
- The taxonomy class is "icmp_error," which aligns with the nature of ICMP-based DoS attacks.
- Involved IP: Source IP 133.16.14.149; Destination IPs include 184.166.242.2, 92.138.56.251, 23.81.108.8, 23.239.156.250, 23.216.115.255, 104.79.225.253, 52.189.217.176, 23.93.192.253, among others. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 133.16.14.149 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this and related IPs.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the host associated with 133.16.14.149 to identify compromise or misuse.
4. Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools to automatically detect and respond to similar attacks.
5. Notify upstream providers if attack traffic originates externally to coordinate filtering.

This targeted response will mitigate the ongoing ping flood and prevent further network degradation.
