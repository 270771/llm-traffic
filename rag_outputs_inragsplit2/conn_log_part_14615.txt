Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the same destination IP 161.67.57.135 from multiple source IPs in the 157.17.x.x range. This pattern of many ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources to a single target is consistent with a distributed ICMP ping flood.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic, which is met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple source IPs (157.17.191.212, 157.17.205.63, 157.17.175.193, etc.) sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 161.67.57.135. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests at the network perimeter targeting 161.67.57.135.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range 157.17.0.0/16 if possible.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with other logs for potential coordinated DDoS.
  4. Notify network operations and consider upstream provider mitigation if attack volume escalates.
