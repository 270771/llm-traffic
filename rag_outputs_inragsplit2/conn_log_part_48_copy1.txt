Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is mostly 0 or 11, not 8, except for one entry where ICMP type is 8 (echo request) from 157.161.144.77 to 44.207.221.41, but this is a single instance.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets overall, which does not meet the threshold for a ping flood.
- No source or destination IPs matching heuristic 20 (ping flood) are present in the anomaly CSV or logs.
- The anomaly record (anomaly_63) references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to a different IP (71.6.113.28) and port, unrelated to ICMP traffic.

Heuristic and taxonomy:
- Heuristic 20 corresponds to ping flood attacks, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets.
- The anomaly found is heuristic 10 (SYN attack), indicating a TCP SYN flood or similar, not ICMP-based.

Next steps:
- Investigate the anomaly_63 further for potential SYN flood activity on IP 71.6.113.28.
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets to detect emerging ping flood attempts.
- Verify if the single ICMP type 8 packet from 157.161.144.77 is benign or part of normal network scanning.
