Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP traffic with type 8 (Echo Request) entries. All connections are TCP or UDP, and the only ICMP-related entry (timestamp 1641099656.374286) has ICMP type 9 (Router Advertisement), which is not type 8.
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets or known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20, none of which are present.
- The anomalies listed relate to TCP suspicious ports and SYN attacks (heuristic 10) or unknown heuristics (999), none indicating ping flood.
- The anomaly taxonomy classes present are 'ptmp' (heuristic 10) and 'heavy_hitter' (heuristic 999), which correspond to SYN attacks and other suspicious traffic, not ICMP ping floods.

Next steps:
- Investigate the suspicious TCP SYN anomalies (heuristic 10) further, as they may indicate SYN flood or scanning activity.
- Monitor for any ICMP Echo Request spikes to detect future ping flood attempts.
- Validate if any hosts in the network are generating excessive SYN packets or unusual TCP connection attempts.

No ping flood attack is detected at this time.
