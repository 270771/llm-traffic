Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: None of the ICMP type fields in the provided conn.log snippet are equal to 8, which is the ICMP Echo Request type required to identify a ping flood. The entries show ICMP types 0, 3, 8 (only once), and 11, but only one instance of type 8 is present, which is insufficient to meet the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets for a ping flood detection. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. ICMP types 3 and 11 correspond to Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded messages, which are normal ICMP control messages and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps: Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic, especially repeated Echo Requests from the same source IPs. If multiple ICMP type 8 packets are observed exceeding the threshold, re-evaluate for ping flood. Also, investigate the source IP 139.179.133.57 that sent the single ICMP type 8 packet for any suspicious behavior.
