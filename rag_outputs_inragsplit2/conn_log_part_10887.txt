Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 8 and 0, but there are only two entries total, each with a single packet.
- The first entry shows ICMP type 0 (Echo Reply), which is not type 8 (Echo Request) and thus not indicative of a ping flood.
- The second entry shows ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) but only one instance, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to consider it a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the instance count rule.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this data.

Next steps:
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Investigate if any of these IPs appear in other logs or anomaly reports.
- If more data becomes available, re-evaluate for potential ICMP-based attacks.
