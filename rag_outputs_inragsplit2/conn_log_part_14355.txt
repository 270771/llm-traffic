Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 3 and 10, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP connection entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances needed to consider a ping flood, unless heuristic 20 applies (no heuristic context or anomalies found here).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Since no ping flood or other attack is detected, no immediate security response is required. However, continued monitoring of ICMP traffic is recommended to detect any future increase in ICMP type 8 packets or suspicious patterns.
