Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- Both ICMP entries have types 11 and 3, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- Only two ICMP connections are present, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 instances.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) are typically related to network errors or traceroute-like activity, not flooding.

Next steps:
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Investigate if these ICMP error messages correlate with other network issues.
- Collect more data or anomaly records to apply heuristics if available.
