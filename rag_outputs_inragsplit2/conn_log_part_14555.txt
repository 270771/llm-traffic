Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 13 and 0, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8; in fact, none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack types.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 13 corresponds to "Timestamp Request" and type 0 to "Echo Reply," which are normal ICMP message types and do not indicate flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.  
- Investigate if the source IPs (133.228.202.193 and 202.194.17.61) have any history of suspicious activity in other logs.
