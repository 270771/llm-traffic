Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP or UDP connections; no ICMP traffic is present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records reference heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (heavy hitter), but none mention heuristic 20 (ping flood).  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which aligns with the TCP SYN flags seen in the conn.log entries (S0 state, SYN sent but no completion).  
- Therefore, the traffic matches a SYN attack pattern, not a ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN flood possibility further by analyzing packet rates and connection attempts from suspicious IPs such as 185.58.127.74 and 133.251.127.196 mentioned in anomalies.  
- Monitor for excessive SYN packets and incomplete TCP handshakes to confirm SYN flood.  
- Apply heuristic 10 (SYN attack) taxonomy for current anomalies.

No ping flood is detected; focus should be on mitigating SYN flood risks.
