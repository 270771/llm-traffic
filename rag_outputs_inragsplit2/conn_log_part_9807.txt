Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic consists exclusively of ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets, which are the hallmark of ping floods.
- There are more than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time frame, indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood.
- Multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.247.95.227, 133.247.26.197, 133.247.26.198, etc.) are targeting a small set of destination IPs (notably 54.214.205.182 and 3.115.159.25), suggesting a distributed ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic taxonomy, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."

**Involved IP addresses:**
- Source IPs: Multiple from 133.247.0.0/16 subnet (e.g., 133.247.95.227, 133.247.26.197, 133.247.111.30, etc.)
- Destination IPs: 54.214.205.182 and 3.115.159.25
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is confirmed.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP ranges.
- Deploy or update Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signatures to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Engage upstream ISP or cloud provider to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic from the attacking IPs.
- Monitor network traffic for continued ICMP flood activity and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or secondary attacks.
- Consider temporary blocking or geo-blocking if the source IPs are from known malicious regions.
- Alert incident response team to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact on services.
