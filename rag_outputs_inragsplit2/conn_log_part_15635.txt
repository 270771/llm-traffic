Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (16.172.102.121) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many targets strongly matches known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the pattern fits heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) commonly associated with ICMP flood attacks.
- The taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" due to the nature of overwhelming ICMP traffic.
- Involved IP: Source IP 16.172.102.121 is the attacker; destination IPs include multiple 163.252.x.x addresses.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 16.172.102.121 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on legitimate ICMP traffic and adjust thresholds accordingly.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify if this source IP is part of a compromised host or botnet.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools.
- Consider blackholing or sinkholing traffic from this source if the attack persists.
- Notify relevant incident response teams to investigate the source host for compromise.
