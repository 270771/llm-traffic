Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 12 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 163.171.168.73 with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which matches the requirement of at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 for a ping flood.
- All ICMP packets are type 8, confirming these are ping requests, consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- The source IP 163.171.168.73 is sending rapid ICMP echo requests to multiple destination IPs within a very short time frame (~0.003 seconds total), indicating high-frequency ping traffic typical of a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches heuristic 1 (ICMP flood) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.171.168.73; multiple destination IPs including 163.252.27.204, 163.252.150.250, 203.78.186.41, 163.252.17.6, 163.252.14.229, 163.252.233.3, 163.252.235.228, 163.252.238.4, 163.252.14.197, 163.252.14.255, 163.252.27.216, 203.78.186.45. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.

Security response plan:
- Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP echo requests from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system to mitigate the flood.
- Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
- Investigate the source host 163.171.168.73 for compromise or misconfiguration causing the flood.
- Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service impact.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools if not already in place.
