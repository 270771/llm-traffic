Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference ICMP or heuristic 20 (Ping flood); they reference heuristics 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (Other).  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which aligns with the many TCP connections showing SYN flags (S0 state), indicating possible SYN scanning or SYN flood attempts, but not ping flood.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the high volume of SYN packets (heuristic 10) for potential SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect future ping flood attempts.  
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for further confirmation of SYN-based attacks.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 indicates SYN attack patterns (high SYN packets or suspicious ports).  
- Taxonomy 'ptmp' and 'mptmp' relate to partial or multiple partial TCP connections, consistent with SYN scanning/flooding behavior.
