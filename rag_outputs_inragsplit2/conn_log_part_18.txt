Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 ICMP connections from source IP 129.43.79.249 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct type for ping floods.
- The volume of ICMP type 8 packets exceeds the threshold of 10 instances, confirming the pattern of a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV identifies heuristic 20 as "Ping flood," which aligns with this traffic pattern.
- The taxonomy class relevant here is "icmp_error" as per anomaly_314, indicating ICMP-related anomalies.
- Involved IPs: Source IP 129.43.79.249 flooding multiple destination IPs in the 133.141.197.x subnet on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the attack vector.

**Security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from 129.43.79.249 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs 133.141.197.64-95 range.
3. Investigate the source host 129.43.79.249 for compromise or misuse.
4. Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools.
5. Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack if it originates externally.
