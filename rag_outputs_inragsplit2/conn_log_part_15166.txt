Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 13 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 35.127.34.186 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different destination IPs strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 35.127.34.186 sending ICMP type 8 packets to multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range. Ports are not applicable for ICMP.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from 35.127.34.186 at the network perimeter firewall.
  2. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with network performance degradation.
  3. Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the suspicious source IP for potential blackholing.
  4. Implement or verify existing ICMP flood detection and mitigation controls in intrusion prevention systems (IPS).
  5. Conduct a forensic review of affected hosts to ensure no compromise beyond the DoS attack.
