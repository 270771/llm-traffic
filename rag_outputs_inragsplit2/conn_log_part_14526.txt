Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP types observed are 3, 11, and 8. Only the entry with ICMP type 8 (echo request) is relevant for ping flood detection.
- There is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet (from 52.188.63.191 to 163.252.224.165), which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The ICMP type 3 and 11 messages correspond to destination unreachable and time exceeded messages, which are normal ICMP control messages, not flooding.

Next steps:
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP.
- Investigate if the source IP 52.188.63.191 shows repeated echo requests over a longer time window.
- Correlate with other logs or anomaly data if available to detect emerging patterns.
