Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: All ICMP entries in the conn.log snippet have ICMP type values other than 8 (the only type indicating an echo request/ping). Specifically, the ICMP type field is mostly 0 or 11, and only one entry shows type 8 but with no repeated instances reaching the threshold of 10. Since the key condition for ping flood detection is at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets (echo requests) unless overridden by known anomalous IPs (none found here), this traffic does not match ping flood patterns.

No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, so no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned. The observed ICMP traffic may represent normal network diagnostic or error messages (e.g., type 11 is Time Exceeded).

Next steps: Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs. Investigate if any hosts show unusual ICMP error messages or other anomalies. Collect heuristic and taxonomy data to improve detection accuracy.
