Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet contains only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in any anomaly records or the log snippet.  
- The anomalies listed relate to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and heavy hitters (heuristic 999), none indicating ICMP or ping flood activity.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which matches some anomalies here (e.g., anomaly_782 and anomaly_2012).  
- The taxonomy classes 'ptmp' and 'heavy_hitter' relate to port-based or volume-based suspicious activity, not ICMP flooding.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomalies further, focusing on source IPs 89.3.89.164 and 185.58.127.74 for potential SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Enable or review ICMP-specific logging to detect any future ping flood attempts.  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP Echo Requests (type 8) to promptly identify ping floods.
