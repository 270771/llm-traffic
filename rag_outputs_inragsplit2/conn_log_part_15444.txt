Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 14 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting the same destination IP 16.161.126.169 within a very short time frame, matching the pattern of a ping flood.
- All ICMP types are 8, which is required for ping flood detection.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple source IPs to a single destination IP strongly indicate a coordinated ping flood attack.
- Although the anomaly CSV does not explicitly reference these IPs or this traffic, the lack of heuristic context means we assign heuristic number 20 (as per instructions for known ping flood heuristics) and taxonomy class "ICMP Flood" as the most likely.
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.197.36, 157.17.19.193, 157.17.70.6, etc.) targeting destination IP 16.161.126.169 on ICMP type 8 (no ports for ICMP).
  
Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and drop excessive ICMP type 8 packets targeting 16.161.126.169.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources involved in the flood.
- Notify network operations to monitor for service degradation on 16.161.126.169 and prepare for possible escalation.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking the source IP ranges if they are not part of legitimate traffic.
