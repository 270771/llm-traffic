Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP (54.193.126.151) from multiple source IPs within the 133.247.x.x range. This pattern matches a classic distributed ICMP ping flood, where many hosts send echo requests to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods is triggered by multiple ICMP type 8 packets (at least 10) targeting the same destination, which is clearly met here.
- The involved IP addresses are multiple sources in the 133.247.0.0/16 subnet sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 54.193.126.151. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable.
- Recommended security response:
  1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests targeting 54.193.126.151 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Block or throttle traffic from the identified source subnet 133.247.0.0/16 if it is not a trusted network.
  3. Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes and correlate with network performance degradation.
  4. Consider deploying ICMP flood detection signatures and alerts in the IDS/IPS.
  5. Notify network operations and incident response teams to investigate potential compromised hosts in the 133.247.0.0/16 range.
