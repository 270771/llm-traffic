Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (52.236.221.123) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly records are present, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 52.236.221.123; Destination IPs include 163.252.249.211, 163.252.176.93, 163.252.176.116, and many others in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from 52.236.221.123 at the network perimeter firewall.
- Monitor for further ICMP traffic spikes from this source and related IPs.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the suspicious source IP for potential blacklisting.
- Implement or verify existing ICMP flood mitigation controls such as ICMP rate limiting or deep packet inspection.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to ensure no internal hosts are compromised and participating in the attack.
