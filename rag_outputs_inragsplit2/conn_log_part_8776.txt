Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), which is the correct ICMP type for ping floods.
- There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets targeting the same destination IPs (notably 52.42.116.124 and 54.212.29.159), indicating a high volume of echo requests consistent with a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context were provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS) Attack."
- Involved IP addresses include multiple source IPs from ranges 133.247.x.x and 157.17.x.x sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IPs 52.42.116.124 and 54.212.29.159. Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP echo requests from the identified source IP ranges at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the affected destination IPs for service degradation or outages.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other signs of coordinated ICMP floods or related DoS activity.
- Engage upstream ISP to filter or throttle traffic from the attacking IP ranges if possible.
- Consider deploying ICMP flood detection and mitigation tools such as anomaly-based IDS signatures or DDoS protection services.
