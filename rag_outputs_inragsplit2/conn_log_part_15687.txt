Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation: The single ICMP record shows type 3 (Destination Unreachable), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood. Additionally, only one ICMP instance is present, far below the threshold of 10 for a ping flood unless heuristic 20 applies (no heuristic data provided). No anomalies or heuristics are indicated in the anomaly CSV.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this single ICMP unreachable message. The lack of heuristic and taxonomy context prevents further classification.

Next steps: Monitor for multiple ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination to detect potential ping floods. Investigate if additional logs show repeated ICMP Echo Requests or other suspicious patterns.
