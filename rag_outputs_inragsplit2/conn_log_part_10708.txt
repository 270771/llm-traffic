Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the required type for ping floods.
- The destination IP 34.25.86.31 is repeatedly targeted by multiple source IPs (e.g., 157.17.224.163, 157.17.131.62, 157.17.9.186, 157.17.68.42, 157.17.224.70, 157.17.22.193, 157.17.113.63, 157.17.238.51, 157.17.22.196, 157.17.238.190, 157.17.157.17, 157.17.238.60), indicating a coordinated flood.
- The volume and repetition of ICMP type 8 packets far exceed the threshold of 10 instances, confirming a ping flood pattern.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context were provided, so by default, this matches heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS) - ICMP Flood."

Involved IPs and ports:
- Source IPs: Multiple, primarily from 157.17.x.x and 69.47.68.36
- Destination IP: 34.25.86.31
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is the key indicator.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IPs at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor the affected destination IP (34.25.86.31) for service degradation or outages.
- Deploy or tune existing DoS mitigation tools to detect and mitigate ICMP flood attacks.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify other potential victims or sources.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs to assist in filtering malicious traffic closer to the source.
