Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type values in the conn.log snippet are 3 and 11, neither of which is type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP entries, far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 3 corresponds to Destination Unreachable, and type 11 corresponds to Time Exceeded, which are normal ICMP control messages rather than attack indicators.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume.  
- Collect more detailed anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.  
- Investigate any unusual patterns in ICMP control messages if they persist or increase.
