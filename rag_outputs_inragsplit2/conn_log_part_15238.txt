Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- Both ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are only two ICMP packets total, far below the threshold of 10 ICMP type 8 packets needed to consider a ping flood.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest other suspicious activity.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. ICMP type 11 is commonly used in traceroute or network diagnostics, not flooding.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Investigate if these ICMP type 11 packets correlate with any network issues or scanning activity.  
- Collect more anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
