Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The heuristic 20 (Ping flood) is not referenced in the anomaly CSV or the logs.  
- The only anomaly present (anomaly_782) relates to heuristic 10 (SYN attack) on port 8080, indicating a possible SYN flood or SYN-based attack, not a ping flood.  

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, which involve abnormal SYN packets on suspicious ports.  
- Taxonomy class 'ptmp' indicates partial or temporary anomalies related to TCP flags and ports, consistent with SYN flood behavior.  

Next steps:  
- Investigate the source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 for potential SYN flood or other TCP-based attacks.  
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic with type 8 to detect future ping flood attempts.  
- Ensure ICMP logging is enabled and properly parsed to catch ping floods if they occur.
