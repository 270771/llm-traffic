Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All ICMP entries have ICMP type 11 (Time Exceeded), not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 instances; in fact, none are present.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP type 11 traffic may be related to traceroute or routing issues, which is normal behavior.

Next steps:
- Investigate the source of ICMP type 11 messages to ensure no network misconfigurations.
- Monitor for any future ICMP type 8 surges that could indicate a ping flood.
