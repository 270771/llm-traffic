Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP connection record shows an ICMP type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood. Additionally, no anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or other indicators.

No other attack type is evident from this single connection entry. ICMP type 8 alone does not imply an attack without volume or corroborating anomalies.

Next steps: Monitor for repeated ICMP type 8 traffic from the same source IP to the same destination IP. If the count reaches or exceeds 10 within a short time frame, re-evaluate for a ping flood. Also, gather anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
