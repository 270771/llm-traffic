Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV only references heuristic 10 (SYN attack) related to suspicious TCP port 8080 traffic from IP 89.3.89.164, not heuristic 20 (ping flood).
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating possible TCP SYN flood or scanning activity, not ICMP flooding.
- The taxonomy class 'ptmp' is assigned to the anomaly, which aligns with port-based TCP anomalies, not ICMP.

Next steps:
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly from 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 further, as it may indicate a TCP SYN flood or reconnaissance.
- Monitor for any ICMP traffic in future logs to detect potential ping floods.
- Verify if any ICMP traffic is filtered or logged elsewhere to ensure no ping flood is missed.

No evidence supports a ping flood attack at this time.
