Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type explicitly shown is 8 in the first entry (ICMP echo request), but there is only 1 instance of ICMP type 8 in the snippet. The other two ICMP entries do not specify type 8 and have missing type fields ("-").  
- The requirement for a ping flood is at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 unless known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20 are present, which is not the case here (no anomaly data found).  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest suspicious behavior or known attack patterns.  
- The traffic does not match other common attack types based on the given data.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the sources 16.172.102.121 and 157.17.228.87 for any unusual activity if more data becomes available.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
