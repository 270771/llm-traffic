Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.183.69.91) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets to many different targets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple hosts with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (commonly associated with volumetric ICMP flood attacks) and fits the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.183.69.91; multiple destination IPs in the 163.252.x.x range.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.183.69.91 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the destination IPs and ensure they are not overwhelmed.
- Conduct a network-wide scan for other signs of DoS activity originating from this or related IPs.
- Notify upstream providers or ISPs about the malicious source IP to assist in mitigation.
- Implement or verify existing ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
