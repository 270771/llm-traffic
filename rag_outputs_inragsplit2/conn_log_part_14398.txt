Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type must be 8 (Echo Request) for ping flood detection. Here, two entries have ICMP type 8, but only one instance each per source-destination pair is present.
- The third entry has ICMP type 32, which is not relevant for ping flood.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 overall, and no anomaly data or heuristic context is provided to override this threshold.
- No known anomalous IPs or ports matching heuristic 20 are present.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Since no anomaly records or heuristics are available, no taxonomy class can be assigned.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests emerges.
- Investigate unusual ICMP types (like 32) if they persist or increase, as they may indicate other network issues.
