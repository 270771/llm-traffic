Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP types observed are 11 and 8. Only one instance of ICMP type 8 (echo request) is present, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to consider a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP type (11) is a Time Exceeded message, unrelated to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or ports that would override the count threshold.  

No other attack patterns are clearly indicated by the given data. Without further evidence or anomalies, no immediate security incident is detected.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate if the source IP 220.130.100.120 or destination IP 203.78.187.167 appear in other logs with suspicious activity.  
- Collect more comprehensive anomaly data and heuristic context to improve detection accuracy.
