Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP traffic present shows ICMP types 3 and 1, not type 8 (Echo Request), which is required for a ping flood.  
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8; in fact, none are present.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The ICMP types 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 1 (Echo Reply) are normal control messages and do not indicate flooding or scanning.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for any increase in ICMP type 8 traffic to detect potential ping floods.  
- Collect more detailed heuristic and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.  
- Investigate the source IP 163.252.9.202 and destination IP 114.47.60.243 if unusual ICMP traffic patterns emerge.
