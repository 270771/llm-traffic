Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type for ping requests (echo request) is 8, which is present in multiple entries from source IP 13.75.4.206 to various destination IPs.
- However, the total count of ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to a single destination is only 1 per entry, and there are no repeated instances targeting the same destination IP that would indicate a flood.
- There are fewer than 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets per destination IP, and no known anomalous IPs or heuristic 20 matches are present to override this threshold.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest otherwise.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. The traffic appears to be normal ICMP echo requests distributed across multiple destinations without flooding behavior.

Next steps:
- Monitor for any increase in frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source to the same destination.
- Investigate if any of the involved IPs (notably 13.75.4.206) show other suspicious activity in other logs.
- Establish baseline ICMP traffic patterns to better detect deviations in the future.
