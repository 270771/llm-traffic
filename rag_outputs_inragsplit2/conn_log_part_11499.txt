Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (54.249.88.154) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is heuristic 20 (excessive ICMP echo requests from a single source).
- Taxonomy class is best assigned as "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack due to the nature of flooding ICMP echo requests.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.249.88.154; Destination IPs include 163.252.10.220, 163.252.239.41, 163.252.239.46, 163.252.238.97, and many others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is the key indicator.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 54.249.88.154 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor network traffic for additional ICMP flood attempts from this or other IPs.
- Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and mitigation rules in network security devices.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to block malicious traffic closer to the source.
