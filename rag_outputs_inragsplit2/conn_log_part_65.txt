Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 129.43.88.254 to multiple destination IPs (133.141.123.33 through 133.141.123.55), all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many targets indicate a flooding behavior consistent with heuristic 20 (Ping flood) from the anomaly taxonomy.
- The anomaly CSV confirms heuristic 20 is associated with ping flood attacks, and the taxonomy class "icmp_error" aligns with ICMP-based anomalies.
- Involved IPs: Source IP 129.43.88.254 (attacker), Destination IPs 133.141.123.33â€“133.141.123.55 (targets). Ports are irrelevant for ICMP but noted as 0.
- Recommendation: Immediately implement rate limiting or blocking of ICMP Echo Requests from 129.43.88.254 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system. Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and consider blacklisting the source IP. Additionally, alert network operations to investigate potential impact on the targeted hosts and ensure no internal systems are compromised or participating in amplification.
