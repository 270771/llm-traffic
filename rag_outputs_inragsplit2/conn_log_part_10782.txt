Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 16 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed toward a single destination IP (54.179.180.7) from multiple source IPs within the 157.17.x.x range.
- This pattern matches a classic ping flood where numerous ICMP Echo Requests are sent rapidly to overwhelm the target.
- Although no explicit heuristic or taxonomy data is provided, the behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known for ICMP flood detection) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: multiple sources (157.17.188.157, 157.17.104.0, 157.17.206.92, etc.) targeting destination 54.179.180.7 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are irrelevant here as ICMP does not use ports, but the ICMP type field confirms the Echo Request.

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on ICMP Echo Requests targeting 54.179.180.7 at the network perimeter firewall.
- Block or throttle traffic from the identified source IP range (157.17.0.0/16) if they are not trusted.
- Monitor for further ICMP flood attempts and correlate with upstream providers to trace and mitigate the attack origin.
- Deploy intrusion prevention system (IPS) signatures tuned to detect and block ICMP flood patterns.
- Notify network operations and incident response teams to prepare for potential escalation or collateral impact.
