Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 163.171.168.73 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets from a single source to many destinations matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by standard heuristic classification, this matches heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection) and falls under the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.171.168.73; multiple destination IPs including 163.252.124.51, 163.252.231.217, 163.252.40.212, and others.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type field is consistently 8.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP echo requests from source IP 163.171.168.73 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on network performance or availability.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source host 163.171.168.73 to determine if it is compromised or misconfigured.
- Implement network-wide ICMP flood detection and alerting rules to catch similar future events.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP if the source is external and persistent.
