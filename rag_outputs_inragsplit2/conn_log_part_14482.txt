Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows no ICMP traffic entries; all records are TCP or UDP.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- Without at least 10 ICMP type 8 instances or any known anomalous IPs matching heuristic 20, the conditions for a ping flood are not met.
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest alternative attack types.

Recommendation:
- Continue monitoring for ICMP traffic, especially type 8 packets.
- Investigate any future anomalies involving ICMP echo requests or repeated connection attempts from suspicious IPs.
- If ICMP traffic appears, verify the count and source/destination IPs against known heuristics for ping floods.
