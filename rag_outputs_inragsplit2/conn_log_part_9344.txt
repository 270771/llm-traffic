Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from source IP 54.254.250.38 to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of ICMP type 8 packets to many different destination IPs strongly matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack, where an attacker overwhelms targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection is the presence of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP without known exceptions.
- The most likely heuristic number is 20 (common in ICMP flood detection), and the taxonomy class is "Denial of Service (DoS)" attack.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 54.254.250.38; Destination IPs include 163.252.125.90, 163.252.202.195, 163.252.131.224, 163.252.36.62, 163.252.131.193, 163.252.44.13, 163.252.131.189, 163.252.179.61, 163.252.44.65, 163.252.231.217, 163.252.179.126, 163.252.158.33, 163.252.179.159, 163.252.150.220, 163.252.188.211, 163.252.158.34, 163.252.150.230.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the ICMP type is consistently 8.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 54.254.250.38 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor for any further ICMP flood attempts from this or related IPs.
3. Notify network operations and affected parties about the ongoing DoS attempt.
4. Consider deploying ICMP flood mitigation tools or services if this is a recurring issue.
5. Review and update firewall rules to restrict unnecessary ICMP traffic to critical assets.
6. Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if any systems were impacted and strengthen defenses accordingly.
