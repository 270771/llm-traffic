Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; there are no ICMP entries present.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- The anomaly CSV records do not reference any IPs or ports related to ICMP or ping flood (heuristic 20).
- The heuristics present (10 and 999) correspond to SYN attacks and other anomalies unrelated to ICMP ping floods.

Recommendation:
- Investigate further by capturing ICMP traffic explicitly (e.g., via Zeekâ€™s icmp.log or packet capture) to detect any ICMP Echo Requests.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP type 8 packets from suspicious IPs, especially those matching heuristic 20.
- Continue to monitor TCP SYN anomalies (heuristic 10) as they may indicate SYN flood or other DoS attacks.

No ping flood is detected; the current anomalies relate to SYN attacks (heuristic 10) and unknown anomalies (heuristic 999).
