Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- All ICMP entries have type 8, which is consistent with echo requests (ping).  
- However, there are only 4 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to confirm a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic does not show the volume or frequency typical of a ping flood attack.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the data. Without anomaly or heuristic context, no alternative attack classification can be confidently assigned.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency or volume of ICMP type 8 packets from these or other IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if the count of ICMP echo requests rises above the threshold.  
- Investigate the source IPs (130.197.154.214, 133.247.187.208, 130.197.150.58, 130.197.154.228) for any other suspicious activity or correlation with known threat intelligence.
