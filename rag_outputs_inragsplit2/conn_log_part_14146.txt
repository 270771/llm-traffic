Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows multiple ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) from source IP 161.67.42.226 to multiple destination IPs (203.78.x.x range). There are well over 10 instances of ICMP type 8 packets within a very short time window, matching the threshold for a ping flood.
- The pattern of one source IP sending numerous ICMP Echo Requests to many different destination IPs is consistent with a classic ICMP ping flood attack, aiming to overwhelm the targets with ICMP traffic.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, this behavior aligns with heuristic 20 (known anomalous src or dst IPs) and the taxonomy class of "Denial of Service (DoS)" attacks.
- Involved IPs: Source IP 161.67.42.226; Destination IPs include 203.78.176.163, 203.78.189.184, 203.78.181.83, 203.78.171.209, 203.78.185.219, 203.78.171.214, 203.78.170.83, 203.78.176.140, 203.78.181.138, 203.78.148.51, 203.78.190.25, 203.78.189.190.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but ICMP type 8 is the key indicator.

Security response plan:
1. Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP Echo Requests from source IP 161.67.42.226 at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
2. Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies from this or related IPs.
3. Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or part of a botnet.
4. Notify affected destination IP owners to prepare for potential service degradation.
5. Implement or tune existing DoS mitigation tools to detect and mitigate similar ICMP floods in the future.
