Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP 16.160.152.89, which matches the known pattern of a ping flood attack.
- The ICMP type is consistently 8, confirming these are ping requests.
- The volume and multiplicity of unique source IPs sending ICMP type 8 packets to the same destination within a very short time frame strongly indicate a distributed ping flood.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP echo requests from multiple sources) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs primarily from the 133.228.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 192.179.223.212, 192.179.223.214) targeting destination IP 16.160.152.89 on ICMP type 8.
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms ping requests.

**Recommended security response plan:**
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests to 16.160.152.89.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP type 8 traffic.
- Investigate and potentially block or quarantine the identified source IPs involved in the flood.
- Monitor network traffic for further ICMP anomalies and consider enabling ICMP logging for detailed analysis.
- Coordinate with upstream providers to filter or mitigate attack traffic if it originates externally.
