Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) appears only twice in the snippet (lines with src IPs 203.78.177.156 and 51.121.111.183). This is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood.  
- Other ICMP types present (3 and 11) are not related to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.  

No other attack type is clearly indicated by this snippet. The presence of ICMP type 3 (Destination Unreachable) and 11 (Time Exceeded) messages may indicate normal network diagnostics or routing issues, not an attack.

Next steps:  
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.  
- Collect more extended logs to verify if a pattern of repeated ICMP Echo Requests emerges.  
- Investigate the source IPs for any known malicious activity using external threat intelligence.
