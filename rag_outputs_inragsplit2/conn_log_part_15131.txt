Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Reasoning:  
- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows only TCP and UDP connections; no ICMP traffic entries are present.  
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are logged, which are required to identify a ping flood.  
- The anomaly CSV does not reference any IPs or ports related to ICMP or heuristic 20 (ping flood).  
- The only heuristics explicitly found are 10 (SYN attack) and 999 (other/mptmp), neither related to ping floods.

Heuristic and taxonomy clarification:  
- Heuristic 10 corresponds to SYN attacks, indicating suspicious TCP SYN packets.  
- Heuristic 20 corresponds to ping flood attacks, which require multiple ICMP type 8 packets.

Next steps:  
- Investigate the SYN attack anomaly (heuristic 10) involving source IP 89.3.89.164 on port 8080 for potential TCP SYN flood or scanning activity.  
- Enable ICMP logging or packet capture to monitor for any future ICMP Echo Request floods.  
- Review firewall and IDS rules to detect and block ICMP flood attempts proactively.
