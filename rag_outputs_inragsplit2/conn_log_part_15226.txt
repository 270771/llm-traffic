Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- The ICMP type in the first entry is 8, which corresponds to an echo request (ping), but there is only 1 instance of this type.
- The second entry has ICMP type 11, which is a Time Exceeded message, not related to ping floods.
- There are fewer than 10 ICMP type 8 packets, and no anomaly records or heuristic context indicate suspicious IPs or known attack patterns.
- Without multiple echo requests or supporting anomaly data, this traffic does not match ping flood criteria.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data.

Next steps:
- Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IPs.
- Investigate if these IPs appear in future anomaly reports or if heuristic 20 (if available) flags them.
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.
