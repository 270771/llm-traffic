Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 15 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 35.173.100.241, which matches the pattern of a ping flood attack where multiple sources send ICMP Echo Requests to overwhelm a target.
- All ICMP types are 8, confirming these are ping requests, and the volume exceeds the threshold of 10 instances.
- No anomaly CSV records or heuristic context are provided, but by default, this matches heuristic 20 (multiple ICMP Echo Requests from diverse sources to a single target) and taxonomy class "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IPs: Multiple source IPs from the 157.17.x.x subnet and others (e.g., 133.247.49.34) are sending ICMP type 8 packets to destination IP 35.173.100.241 on ICMP port 0 (ICMP does not use ports, but Zeek logs 0 here).

Security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 35.173.100.241.
- Deploy an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to detect and block excessive ICMP Echo Requests from multiple sources.
- Notify network operations to monitor the target host for service degradation.
- Consider blacklisting or geo-blocking suspicious source IP ranges if they are not legitimate users.
- Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify if these sources are part of a botnet or compromised hosts.
