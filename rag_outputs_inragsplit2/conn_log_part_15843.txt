Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

The traffic matches known ping flood patterns because there are over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) targeting a single destination IP (52.236.221.123) within a very short time frame (all timestamps within milliseconds). This volume and concentration of ICMP Echo Requests from multiple source IPs strongly indicate a coordinated ICMP ping flood attack aimed at overwhelming the target.

Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood heuristic, which typically involves multiple ICMP type 8 packets sent rapidly to a single victim IP. The most likely heuristic number to assign is **heuristic 20**, which commonly corresponds to ICMP flood detection in many taxonomy frameworks. The taxonomy class is **Denial of Service (DoS) Attack**.

Involved IP addresses:
- Source IPs: Multiple (e.g., 157.17.227.20, 157.17.225.7, 157.17.177.195, etc.)
- Destination IP: 52.236.221.123
- Ports: ICMP does not use ports, but ICMP type 8 is the key indicator.

Recommended security response plan:
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests destined for 52.236.221.123.
2. Deploy or update intrusion prevention system (IPS) rules to detect and mitigate ICMP flood patterns.
3. Coordinate with upstream ISPs to filter or block malicious traffic sources if possible.
4. Monitor network traffic for further anomalous ICMP activity and correlate with other logs for potential lateral movement or follow-up attacks.
5. Consider temporarily disabling ICMP Echo Replies on the target host if operationally feasible to reduce attack surface.
