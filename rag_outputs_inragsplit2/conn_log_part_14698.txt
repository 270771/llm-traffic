Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows at least 20 distinct ICMP connections from a single source IP (163.171.168.73) to multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker sends numerous echo requests to overwhelm targets.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the behavior aligns with a classic ICMP ping flood heuristic (commonly heuristic 20 in many taxonomies), which flags high-frequency ICMP echo requests from one source to many destinations.
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 163.171.168.73; multiple destination IPs including 163.252.148.62, 203.78.171.216, 133.251.127.234, and others. ICMP does not use ports, so ports are not applicable here.

Recommended security response plan:
- Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter to block or throttle ICMP echo requests originating from 163.171.168.73.
- Conduct a network-wide scan to identify any compromised hosts or malware on 163.171.168.73 that may be generating this traffic.
- Alert network operations and incident response teams to monitor for collateral impact on the targeted IPs.
- Consider blacklisting or quarantining the source IP until the cause is remediated.
- Review firewall and IDS/IPS rules to detect and mitigate similar ICMP flood patterns proactively.
