Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The only ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) instance is from 157.17.231.174 to 44.61.16.153, and there is only 1 such instance, which is below the threshold of at least 10 required to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entry is type 11 (Time Exceeded), which is not relevant to ping floods.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. The heuristic for ping flood detection requires multiple ICMP type 8 packets, which is not met here.

Next steps:  
- Continue monitoring for increased ICMP type 8 traffic volume from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate any sudden spikes in ICMP traffic or related anomalies if they appear in future logs.
