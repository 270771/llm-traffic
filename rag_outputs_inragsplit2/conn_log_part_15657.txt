Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type in both entries is 8, which corresponds to echo request (ping).  
- However, there are only 2 instances of ICMP type 8 in the snippet, which is below the threshold of at least 10 instances required to indicate a ping flood attack.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or exceptions (heuristic 20) that would lower the threshold.  
- The traffic does not show a high volume or rapid repetition characteristic of a ping flood.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the given data. Without additional anomalies or heuristic context, no further specific investigation is warranted based on this snippet alone. If more data becomes available, monitoring for increased ICMP echo request frequency or related anomalies is recommended.
