Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

The single ICMP record shows type 8 (echo request), but only one instance is present, which is far below the threshold of at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets required to indicate a ping flood. No anomaly records or heuristic context are available to suggest known suspicious IPs or other attack patterns.

No other attack type is evident from this single connection log entry. Without multiple repeated ICMP echo requests or additional anomaly data, this traffic appears benign or normal ICMP probing.

Next steps: Monitor for increased frequency of ICMP type 8 packets from the same source IP (139.179.133.57) to the destination (203.78.173.48). If counts rise above 10 in a short time frame, re-evaluate for potential ping flood. Also, gather heuristic context and anomaly data to improve detection accuracy.
