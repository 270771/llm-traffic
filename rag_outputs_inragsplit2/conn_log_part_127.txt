Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections originating from a single source IP (124.121.97.181) targeting multiple destination IPs, all with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), which is the exact type used in ping floods.
- The volume and rapid succession of these ICMP type 8 packets strongly match known ping flood patterns, where an attacker overwhelms multiple targets with ICMP echo requests.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping floods is typically heuristic 20 (ICMP flood detection), and the taxonomy class would be "Denial of Service (DoS)".
- Involved IP addresses: Source IP 124.121.97.181; multiple destination IPs including 133.250.64.36, 163.21.29.224, 163.21.163.253, and others.
- Ports are irrelevant for ICMP, but the ICMP type field confirms type 8 (Echo Request).

Security response plan:
- Immediately block or rate-limit ICMP traffic from source IP 124.121.97.181 at the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
- Monitor for any collateral impact on the targeted destination IPs and ensure their availability.
- Conduct a forensic investigation on the source IP to determine if it is compromised or spoofed.
- Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools.
- Consider deploying upstream filtering or contacting the ISP to mitigate the attack closer to the source.
