Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The traffic shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request), all targeting the single destination IP 50.239.214.145. This high volume of ICMP type 8 packets from multiple source IPs to the same destination matches the classic pattern of a ping flood attack.
- Although no explicit anomaly records or heuristic context are provided, the known heuristic for ping flood detection requires at least 10 instances of ICMP type 8 traffic, which is clearly met here.
- Involved IP addresses: Multiple source IPs in the 133.228.x.x range (e.g., 133.228.127.253, 133.228.214.254, 133.228.23.166, etc.) are sending ICMP Echo Requests to destination IP 50.239.214.145 on ICMP protocol (no ports applicable).
- Recommended security response plan:
  1. Immediately rate-limit or block ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.228.0.0/16) at the perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system.
  2. Monitor the destination host 50.239.214.145 for service degradation or resource exhaustion.
  3. Investigate the source IPs for possible compromise or misuse.
  4. Implement ICMP flood detection and alerting rules in network monitoring tools.
  5. Consider deploying upstream filtering or engaging the ISP to mitigate the flood if it persists.

This is a clear case of an ICMP ping flood attack based on the volume and type of ICMP traffic observed.
