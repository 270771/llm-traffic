Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:  
- The ICMP type field in the conn.log snippet is the 4th column after the timestamp and UID. The entries with ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) are only two instances from source IP 163.171.168.73 to two different destination IPs. This is fewer than the required minimum of 10 ICMP type 8 packets to indicate a ping flood.  
- The other ICMP entries have types 11 and 0, which do not qualify as ping flood indicators.  
- No anomaly records or heuristic context are provided to suggest known suspicious IPs or heuristic 20 matches that would override the count threshold.  

No other attack pattern is clearly indicated by the data. The heuristic and taxonomy context is unavailable, so no alternative classification can be assigned.  

Next steps:  
- Monitor for an increase in ICMP type 8 traffic volume from the same source IPs.  
- Investigate the source IP 163.171.168.73 for unusual behavior or reputation issues.  
- Collect more comprehensive logs to detect potential low-rate or stealthy ICMP-based attacks.
