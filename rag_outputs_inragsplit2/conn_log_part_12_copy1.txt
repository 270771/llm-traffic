Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is happening.

- The Zeek conn.log snippet shows over 20 distinct ICMP connections with type 8 (Echo Request) directed at a single destination IP 3.30.218.60 from multiple source IPs in the 133.240.x.x range. This pattern of numerous ICMP Echo Requests from many sources to one target matches the classic distributed ping flood attack signature.
- The anomaly CSV explicitly references heuristic 20, which corresponds to a ping flood, with the anomaly category code "ntscICecrqICecrprp" indicating a NetworkScanICMP type anomaly consistent with ICMP-based scanning or flooding.
- Involved IPs: multiple source IPs (e.g., 133.240.143.232, 133.240.243.19, 133.240.179.31, etc.) targeting destination IP 3.30.218.60 on ICMP type 8 (ping).
- Ports are not applicable for ICMP, but the consistent ICMP type 8 confirms the traffic is ping requests.

**Recommended security response plan:**
1. Immediately implement rate limiting or filtering on the network perimeter firewall or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to block or throttle ICMP Echo Requests from the identified source IP range (133.240.0.0/16).
2. Monitor the target host 3.30.218.60 for signs of service degradation or resource exhaustion.
3. Engage upstream ISP or network provider to assist in filtering or blackholing traffic from the attacking IPs if the attack volume escalates.
4. Conduct a forensic review of the source IPs to determine if they are compromised hosts part of a botnet.
5. Update incident response documentation to include this event and notify relevant stakeholders.

This attack matches heuristic 20 (Ping flood) and taxonomy class "NetworkScanICMP," which indicates a denial-of-service attempt using ICMP Echo Requests.
