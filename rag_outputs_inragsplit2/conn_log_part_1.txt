Based on the current log, a ping flooding attack is not happening.

Explanation:
- All entries in the provided Zeek conn.log snippet are TCP connections (proto field = 6), with no ICMP traffic recorded.
- No ICMP type 8 (Echo Request) packets are present, which are required to identify a ping flood.
- There are no anomaly records or heuristic context indicating suspicious IPs or ports related to ICMP or ping flood activity.
- Without ICMP traffic, the conditions for a ping flood (at least 10 ICMP type 8 packets or heuristic 20 matches) cannot be met.

No other attack type is clearly indicated by the current data. The TCP connection attempts show normal connection states (S0, SF, RSTR, OTH) without signs of flooding or scanning patterns.

Next steps:
- Investigate network logs that specifically capture ICMP traffic (e.g., Zeek icmp.log) to detect potential ping floods.
- Monitor for any sudden spikes in ICMP Echo Requests or anomalies in ICMP traffic volume.
- Correlate with firewall or IDS logs for ICMP-related alerts.

Since no heuristic or taxonomy data is available, no further classification can be assigned at this time.
